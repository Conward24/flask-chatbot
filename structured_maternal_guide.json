Most of these questions are reasonable and natural, and\nshould be frankly answered; but a false conventionality has--until\nrecently, at least--forbidden any open discussion of facts connected\nwith childbirth. The inevitable result has been that, without\nexperience of their own to guide them, prospective mothers have\nsought advice from older women, whose experience was at best very\nnarrow, and whose views were often biased by tradition. Or,\ndistrusting such sources of information, they have consulted\ntechnical medical works which they could not understand. Either of\nthese methods is very likely to result in misinformation and to cause\nunnecessary anxiety. Yet no one need be alarmed by a plain, accurate\naccount of Nature's plan to provide successive generations of human\nbeings. Some trustworthy knowledge of a process so fundamental should\nbe part of every person's education; it is especially helpful to\nwomen who are pregnant because it affords a rational basis for\nhygienic measures which they should adopt. A popular work, however,\nno matter how frank and helpful it may be, will not enable one to\ndispense with professional advice. For the prospective mother no\ncounsel is more important than this: _Put yourself at once under\nthe care of a physician_.\n\nInsistence on the importance of medical advice should not be taken to\nimply that pregnancy is to be regarded as other than a normal\nprocess. Its dangers are comparatively slight, as we should expect,\nsince the property of all living matter to reproduce its kind is both\nfundamental and essential; the continuance of living creatures in\nthis world, plants as well as animals, depends upon the Reproductive\nProcess. And yet, natural as it is, pregnancy may be attended by\ncomplications. Such complications, though happily rare, are to be\nguarded against in every case, and that may be most effectually done\nif patients are taught to remain under competent medical supervision\nfrom the time of conception until several weeks after the child is\nborn. This precaution greatly reduces the frequency of annoyances\nduring pregnancy and also assists materially toward conducting a\nbirth to a safe conclusion. Moreover, if this advice is followed,\nwhen complications do arise they will be recognized and dealt with\npromptly; they will not be permitted to grow more serious until,\nperhaps, they may jeopardize the life of the mother or the child or\nboth.\n\nThe initial symptoms of pregnancy are so widely known that in most\ninstances the prospective mother herself makes the diagnosis shortly\nafter conception has taken place; but now and then pregnancy advances\nfor several months unrecognized and is then detected by a physician\nwho has been consulted on account of symptoms which the patient has\nincorrectly attributed to some other condition. On the other hand,\nwomen sometimes suspect that they are pregnant when they are not; and\nsuch mistakes occur because certain symptoms which are implicitly\ntrusted by the laity as manifestations of pregnancy are occasionally\nassociated with conditions quite foreign to it. It is clear that one\ninterested in the matter must know not only what the manifestations\nof pregnancy are and when they appear, but also how far the evidence\nthat they give is reliable.\n\nThe signs of pregnancy may be classified, according to their\nreliability, as presumptive, probable, and positive. The doubtful\nevidence appears first and the infallible proof last. No one need be\nsurprised, therefore, if, when her suspicion is first aroused, she is\nunable to decide positively whether she is pregnant. Physicians of\nbroad experience, possessed of facilities for observation which their\npatients cannot employ, may find it necessary to make more than one\nexamination before they commit themselves to a definite opinion; in\nsome cases, though very rarely, they must wait for two or three\nmonths to be able to do this.\n\nTHE POSITIVE SIGNS.--The earliest absolutely trustworthy\nmanifestation of pregnancy is the motion of the fetus. The perception\nby the mother of these movements, which is spoken of as \"quickening,\"\ngenerally occurs toward the eighteenth week, if she has been told to\nwatch for them; otherwise they may pass unnoticed until the twentieth\nweek or later. At first the motion, felt in the lower part of the\nabdomen, is very gentle; it has been variously likened to tapping, or\nto quivering, or to the fluttering of a bird's wings. As time goes on\nthe movements grow stronger and occur more frequently; they are,\nhowever, perceived but rarely throughout the day and seldom interfere\nwith sleep. Occasionally women are annoyed by the sensation and\ncomplain that the child is hardly ever quiet. Even these troublesome\nmovements are never a cause for anxiety; but prolonged failure to\nfeel motion after it is once well established should be reported to\nthe doctor.\n\nIn the first pregnancy the passage of gas through the intestines may\nbe mistaken for quickening long before the movements of the child are\nreally perceptible; but those who have once experienced quickening\nwill not be deceived. Whenever women who have borne children are in\ndoubt the sensation is almost surely not quickening. Furthermore, in\nany doubtful case, the motion should be observed by a physician\nbefore being accounted a positive sign of pregnancy. This precaution\nwill scarcely delay an absolutely positive diagnosis, since the\nproper method of examination reveals these movements to the physician\nalmost as early as the patient feels them.\n\nAbout the time these movements become perceptible another positive\nsign is available. The physician whose ear has been trained to catch\nsuch sounds when he listens over the lower part of the mother's\nabdomen will hear the fetal heart-beat. Other sounds may be audible\nthere, but the character and the rate of the heart-sounds are\ndistinctive. Since the child's heart beats almost twice as fast as\nthe mother's, under ordinary conditions it is impossible to confuse\none with the other. The mother never feels the beating of the child's\nheart, but occasionally she will mistake for it the throbbing of her\nown blood vessels.\n\nAbility to hear the fetal heart not only provides a means of\nconfirming the existence of pregnancy in doubtful cases, but also\nenables the physician to reassure his patient if she fails\ntemporarily to feel the child move. Sometimes the presence of twins\nis recognized in this way. Toward the end of pregnancy the heart\nsounds are also of material assistance in determining what position\nthe child has permanently assumed.\n\nThere is a third positive sign of pregnancy to which the physician\nhas recourse, but generally it is inapplicable as early as those\nalready mentioned. In the latter months of pregnancy it is possible\nto outline the child through the mother's abdominal wall. Although\nthis procedure adds little or nothing to our resources for making an\nearly diagnosis, the information it ultimately affords proves one of\nthe greatest aids in the practice of obstetrics.\n\nTHE PROBABLE SIGNS.--Obviously, phenomena for which the child is\nresponsible--such as have just been described--supply the most\ntrustworthy evidence of pregnancy; and these phenomena alone are\naccepted as positive signs. But there are earlier manifestations\nwhich intimate very strongly that conception has taken place. Shortly\nafter pregnancy has become established changes begin in the uterus,\nas physicians call the womb, and soon reach the point where they may\nbe recognized by a simple examination which enables the physician to\nexpress an opinion little less than positive. As one result of\npregnancy, for example, the supply of blood is increased to all the\norgans concerned with the reproductive process. Partly on account of\nthis congestion and partly on account of embryonic development, the\nuterus becomes altered in a number of ways. Although these changes\noccur regularly in pregnancy, they may also occur when the womb is\nenlarged from other causes; therefore, if a physician should make the\ndiagnosis of pregnancy whenever they were found, he would make it\nsomewhat too frequently. With a little patience, however, he excludes\nthe chance of being misled; a second examination, approximately four\nweeks after the first, will generally place the existence of\npregnancy beyond question, for under normal conditions the degree of\nenlargement which takes place in a pregnant womb during a given\ninterval is absolutely characteristic.\n\nTHE PRESUMPTIVE SIGNS.--Although women are most often led to suspect\nthat they are pregnant by symptoms which are of such doubtful\nsignificance that they must be regarded as merely presumptive\nevidence, the practical value of these symptoms is attested by the\nfact that subsequent developments rarely fail to confirm the\nsuspicion. Perhaps they prove misleading once or twice in a hundred\ncases; the number of mistakes is small, because the diagnosis is\ncommonly made not from only one of these doubtful signs but from a\ngroup of them. In order of importance the doubtful or presumptive\nsigns of pregnancy are these: (1) cessation of menstruation, (2)\nchanges in the breasts, (3) morning sickness, (4) disturbances in\nurination.\n\n_The Cessation of Menstruation_.--The failure of menstruation to\nappear when it is expected is nearly always the first symptom of\npregnancy to attract attention, and, as a rule, when this happens to\nhealthy women during the child-bearing period--which usually extends\nfrom the fifteenth to the forty-fifth year--it may be taken to\nindicate that conception has occurred. But there are exceptions to\nthis very good rule. Besides pregnancy we are acquainted with several\nconditions that cause temporary suppression of menstruation; and to\nunderstand its significance we must learn something of the menstrual\nprocess itself.\n\nMenstruation is a function of the womb and in all probability is\nbrought about through the influence of the ovaries. The bleeding,\npopularly regarded as the entire menstrual process, is, in fact,\nindicative of only one of its stages; the others give rise to no\nsymptoms whatever. What the stages in the menstrual process are, what\nrelation they bear to each other, and what the significance of the\nwhole process is, are problems that have been solved with the aid of\nthe microscope. In this way the mucous membrane lining the womb has\nbeen studied both at the time of the periods and in the interval\nbetween them, and we have learned that it is constantly undergoing\nchanges intended to facilitate the reception and the maintenance of\nan embryo. Anticipating these duties the mucous membrane receives a\nmore abundant supply of blood; it also increases in thickness and all\nthe structures which enter into its composition become more active.\nUnless conception takes place these preparations, which represent the\nmost important phase in the menstrual process, are without value; and\ntherefore failure to conceive means that the mucous membrane will\nreturn to the same condition as existed before the preparations were\nbegun. The congestion is relieved by rupture of the smallest blood\nvessels, and there follow other retrogressive steps which completely\nrestore the various structures to their former state. Then there is a\npause, though it is not long, until preparatory changes are again\ninitiated, or, as we say, another Menstrual Cycle is begun. Each\ncycle lasts twenty-eight days, and includes four stages, namely, a\nstage of preparation, of bleeding, of restoration, and of rest.\n\nAlthough pregnancy may become established at any time during the\ninterval between the periods of bleeding, it is more likely to be\nestablished just before a period is expected or shortly after it has\nceased. Furthermore, whenever conception does take place, the\npreliminary preparations for the reception of the embryo are followed\nby much more elaborate arrangements for its protection and nutrition.\nUnder these circumstances the hemorrhagic discharge does not appear.\n\nWere there no other condition to bring about the cessation of\nmenstruation, the diagnosis of pregnancy would be greatly simplified.\nBut any one can appreciate the fact that diseases of the womb may\ninterfere with the menstrual process. Menstruation is influenced,\nalso, by the ovaries. As a result of age, for example, the ovaries\nundergo changes which invariably bring about the permanent cessation\nof menstruation, called the menopause. This event occurs prematurely\nif both the ovaries are removed by operation. In view of these facts\nit is not surprising that sometimes ovarian disorders abolish\nmenstruation. An impoverished state of the blood, or nervous shock\nand strain, or constitutional debility may also interrupt the regular\nappearance of the menstrual discharge.\n\nThe value of menstrual suppression as an evidence of pregnancy is\nnot, however, to be discounted to the extent that we might expect.\nThis is true because the ailments which lead to confusion are\nrelatively infrequent, and also because they exhibit characteristic\nsymptoms which are foreign to pregnancy. Often these symptoms are\nobvious to the patient herself; if not to her, they will be obvious\nto her physician. It is about the doubtful cases, naturally, that a\nprofessional opinion is sought, and on that account physicians are\nperhaps inclined to overestimate the difficulty women have in\nlearning for themselves whether or not they are pregnant. As a matter\nof fact, it is unusual for a prospective mother to fail to reach a\ncorrect decision--a decision for which she relies chiefly upon the\nsuppression of her menstrual periods.\n\nIt is doubtful whether menstruation ever continues after conception\nhas taken place. Instances in which the menstrual function is\nbelieved to persist are not uncommon, and yet in all probability the\ndischarge regarded as menstrual has a different origin. In most cases\nit should be interpreted as meaning that there is some danger of\nmiscarriage. Since miscarriage often occurs about the time a\nmenstrual period would ordinarily be expected, there is unusual\nopportunity for confusing the symptoms. At all events women err much\nmore frequently in suspecting that they are pregnant than in\noverlooking the condition. Indeed, pregnancy is not likely to be\noverlooked unless menstruation has been irregular or suppressed for a\nmonth or more previous to conception. Thus, in the case of nursing\nmothers in whom menstruation is already suppressed and who are,\nmoreover, deprived of certain evidence that the breasts give,\npregnancy may sometimes advance several months before it is\nrecognized.\n\n_The Changes in the Breasts_.--Various sensations in the breasts\nare accepted by women as a reliable sign of pregnancy; thus\nthrobbing, tingling, pricking, or a feeling of fullness will be\nmentioned by one mother or another as having given her the first\nintimation that she was pregnant. A few women also find their breasts\nbecome tender immediately after they have conceived; this may be so\nmarked that they cannot bear pressure. But unless such symptoms are\naccompanied by definite, visible changes, they have no value as signs\nof pregnancy.\n\nAbout the end of the second month the nipples become larger and more\nerectile, and deepen in color. The pigmented, circular area of skin\nwhich surrounds the nipple, called the areola, also darkens. The\nshade that the areola assumes will vary according to the complexion\nof the individual, growing darker in brunettes than in blondes.\nUltimately, within this pigmented circle a number of elevated spots\nappear about the size of a large shot. These spots betray the\npresence of tiny glands always located there which, on account of the\nbetter state of nutrition during pregnancy, grow larger, and\ngenerally become visible.\n\nUsually, after two menstrual periods have been missed the breasts\nincrease in size and firmness, and often the veins which run just\nbeneath the skin stand out conspicuously. Before very long it is\npossible to squeeze from the breasts a fluid which many persons\nbelieve to be milk, though it is really colostrum, a substance that\nresembles milk but very slightly. At first colostrum is a clear,\nwhite fluid, but in the later months of pregnancy it becomes yellow\nand cloudy.\n\nNone of the changes in the breasts are absolutely characteristic of\npregnancy; even the secretion of colostrum has been noted in\nassociation with various other conditions. Furthermore, as a sign of\npregnancy the presence of colostrum is totally deprived of value in\nthe case of a woman who has recently nursed an infant, for a small\nquantity of milk or colostrum often remains in the breasts for months\nafter the infant is weaned. In general, however, women who have not\nbeen pregnant before should assume that they have conceived if, after\nmissing a menstrual period, they note the characteristic changes in\nthe breasts.\n\n_Morning Sickness_.--Soon after conception many women suffer\nfrom nausea and vomiting, especially on rising in the morning.\n\"Morning sickness\" usually passes off in a few hours, although it may\nbe more persistent. Perhaps this manifestation occurs more frequently\nin the first than in subsequent pregnancies, but certainly one-half,\nand probably two-thirds, of all prospective mothers suffer from it.\nUsually the nausea begins just after a menstrual period has been\nmissed, and ceases about the third month or a little later.\n\nBut morning sickness is never counted an indication of pregnancy\nunless taken in conjunction with other symptoms, for individuals who\nare not pregnant may also suffer from nausea in the morning. On the\nother hand, a number of prospective mothers escape morning sickness\naltogether, and a few experience nausea at other times of day.\n\n_Disturbances in Urination_.--It is not an uncommon belief that\nsome characteristic change occurs in the urine shortly after\nconception. But this is not true; at least no change is revealed by\nany method of analysis known at present. Yet there are symptoms\nassociated with the passage of the urine which appear very promptly\nand prevail for several weeks. Chief among these is the desire to\nempty the bladder frequently; some patients also have difficulty in\nurination, and a few experience discomfort with it. All the bladder\nsymptoms gradually disappear about the fourth month, but become\nprominent again toward the end of pregnancy.\n\nSince the inclination to empty the bladder more often than usual may\nbe due merely to nervousness or to many other conditions, this\nsymptom taken alone cannot be regarded as a definite sign of\npregnancy. Indeed, it is mentioned, not because of its importance,\nbut to point out that it is in no way connected with the kidneys, as\npatients are sometimes led to believe. It is a direct and natural\nresult of pregnancy. Since the womb enlarges and tilts forward at a\nmore acute angle than formerly, it presses against the bladder,\ngiving the same sensation as when the bladder is distended with\nurine.\n\nAlthough the presumptive signs which we have considered by no means\nexhaust the list, all the others are totally untrustworthy. Each of\nthe more reliable symptoms, as we have seen, must be accepted\ncautiously; but taken altogether, except in very unusual cases, they\nmay be relied upon. _If, for example, menstruation has previously\nbeen regular and then a period is missed, the patient has good reason\nto suspect she is pregnant; if the next period is also missed and\nmeanwhile the breasts have enlarged, the nipples darkened, and the\nsecretion of colostrum has begun, it is nearly certain that she is\npregnant; whether morning sickness and the desire to pass the urine\nfrequently are present is of no importance._ But the most\ncharacteristic evidence, we must remember, is not available until the\neighteenth or twentieth week; then the signs of pregnancy are\nunmistakable.\n\nTHE DURATION OF PREGNANCY.--After the existence of pregnancy has\nbecome assured, perhaps the greatest interest centers about the date\nupon which the birth may be expected. Even to approach accuracy in\nthis prediction the prospective mother must be familiar with certain\nfacts which she will always observe, but which, unless she\nappreciates their importance early in pregnancy, she may fail to\nrecord or to remember. In a few cases, however, such exceptional\ninformation as knowing the date of conception does not lead to an\nabsolutely accurate prediction. But the deviation from the rule will\nbe understood only after we understand the rule itself, which is\nbased upon what we accept as the average duration of human pregnancy,\ntechnically called the period of gestation.\n\nIn a broad sense, the period of gestation for each variety of mammal\nis determined by the time required for embryonic development to reach\nthe point where the young may live independently of the mother. This\npoint is reached more quickly with small animals than with large. The\nmouse, for example, generally brings forth its young in three weeks,\nwhereas the pregnancy of the elephant lasts two years. In human\nbeings, counting from the time of conception to the time of delivery,\npregnancy continues approximately 273 days. This number is merely an\nestimate calculated from hundreds of cases in which there was no\nquestion as to the underlying facts. Individual cases vary notably,\nand indicate that two women may become pregnant on the same day and\nyet not necessarily be delivered at the same date.\n\nIrregularities in the duration of pregnancy are not limited to man.\nThus, while the mean period of gestation in the rabbit is thirty-one\ndays, it may be either shorter or longer by as many as eight days.\nSimilar variations occur in the pregnancies of all animals, and are,\nmoreover, notably greater among larger animals, since for such\nanimals the period of gestation is relatively long. For instance, the\naccurate observations of veterinarians indicate that the mean period\nof pregnancy in the cow is 285 days from the time of conception. This\nfact notwithstanding, a competent observer found that, of 160 cows,\n67 were delivered before the 280th day; 68 between the 280th and the\n290th day; and 25 after the 290th day. Although nothing unnatural was\nobserved in any instance, the first animal was delivered 67 days\nbefore the last, and in 5 instances gestation continued 308 days.\n\nIn ancient times it was believed that the duration of pregnancy was\nof even more uncertain length in man than in the lower animals; but\nsince the eighteenth century thirty-nine weeks have been accepted as\nthe average duration of the human pregnancy when reckoned from the\nday of conception. As this date is seldom known, it is most\nconvenient to reckon from the first day of the last menstrual period.\nEstimated in this way its average duration is 280 days. As this\nperiod corresponds to ten menstrual cycles, physicians prefer to\ndescribe pregnancy as lasting 10 lunar months of four weeks each.\nThis is equivalent to 9 calendar months, in terms of which its\nduration is popularly stated.\n\nTHE ESTIMATION OF THE DATE OF CONFINEMENT.--Since pregnancy is not an\nabsolutely fixed period, we possess no reliable means of predicting\nthe exact day when it will end. The most satisfactory method of\nprediction consists in counting forward 280 days from the beginning\nof the last menstruation or, what gives the same result, counting\nbackward eighty-five days from this date. _To make the calculation\nin the simplest way we count back three months and add seven\ndays_; this addition is made because seven days generally\nrepresents the difference between three months and eighty-five days.\nIf the last menstruation, for example, began on October 30th, we\ncount back three months to July 30th and add seven days, which gives\nAugust 6th as the probable date of confinement.\n\nA prospective mother should remember that this prediction is no more\nthan approximate. The calculation does not give the exact date of\ndelivery more than four or five times in a hundred cases. It is\naccurate within a week in half the cases and within two weeks in\nfour-fifths. We also know that delivery is somewhat more likely to\noccur after the expected date than before it. But perhaps we shall\nget the clearest idea of the accuracy of the rule, or better still\nof its inaccuracy, if we imagine twenty patients to have the same\npredicted date, all of them giving birth to mature infants. The\nchances are that only one of these patients will be confined upon the\nday predicted; nine will be confined before and ten after it. In all\nprobability five of those who pass the predicted day will be\ndelivered within a week and four others within the second week, while\nthe twentieth patient will not be delivered until three weeks or more\nhave elapsed.\n\nSuch results clearly indicate our inability to make accurate\npredictions even though pregnancy is normal in every way. Whenever\npatients pass their expected date uneventfully, if they will bear in\nmind that the fault lies with the method of prediction and not with\nthe pregnancy, they will often be saved anxiety. Frequently such\ndiscrepancies are attributable to a false assumption, for our rule\nalways assumes that the conception took place immediately after a\nmenstrual period. While this is generally true, the number of cases\nin which it occurs just before the period to be missed is by no means\ninconsiderable, and in these we should not expect pregnancy to end\nuntil two or three weeks after the day predicted by the rule.\n\nOccasionally patients know the precise day upon which conception took\nplace, and prefer to estimate the day of confinement from that rather\nthan from the beginning of the last menstruation. They may do so by\ncounting back thirteen weeks from the day of conception; but this\nmethod also is subject to error for, as we have noted, the duration\nof pregnancy reckoned in this more exact manner is not constant. Such\na calculation rarely offers any advantage over that made from the\nmenstrual record.\n\nAnother method of estimating the date of confinement is based upon\nthe assumption that fetal movements are first perceived by the mother\ntoward the eighteenth week of pregnancy; and in consequence twenty-\ntwo weeks generally elapse between quickening and the day of\ndelivery. Although such a calculation is far from certain in its\nprediction, there are instances in which no other calculation can be\nmade. A nursing mother, for example, may become pregnant before\nmenstruation has been reestablished. Under these circumstances,\nobviously, the date of confinement cannot be estimated in the\nordinary way, and it is then especially important to know the first\nday on which the fetal movements were felt. Furthermore, it is\nhelpful to note this date in every case, since it serves, if for\nnothing more, to confirm the prediction made from the menstrual\nrecord. Besides the two methods just described, which are alike in\nthat they require the patient herself to make the necessary\nobservations, there is a third method of estimating how far pregnancy\nhas advanced, by which the physician is enabled to draw his own\nconclusions. This method is based upon the fact that the womb\nenlarges from month to month during pregnancy at a constant rate. Up\nto the end of the third lunar month it cannot be felt through the\nabdominal wall; but in the course of the fourth month, on account of\nits size, it must rise into the abdominal cavity. At the beginning of\nthe sixth month the top of the womb is at the level of the navel, and\nat the ninth reaches the ribs. The diaphragm then prevents the womb\nfrom going higher; and two or three weeks before the end of pregnancy\nit drops several inches, causing a change in the figure which is\nnoticeable to the patient, since her skirts hang somewhat lower than\nbefore. From this time on she is more comfortable, because the lungs\nare not crowded, and there is less interference with breathing.\n\nThese alterations in the position of the womb indicate very\nsatisfactorily the month to which pregnancy has advanced, but not the\nweek and much less the day. They do not afford a more accurate means\nof predicting the date of confinement than does quickening. The\nevidence gained from the position of the womb, like that afforded by\nthe beginning of quickening, generally confirms the prediction made\nfrom the menstrual history; it serves only occasionally to correct\nit.\n\nPROLONGED PREGNANCY.--Since birth does not occur in many cases until\nthe predicted date has been passed, it will be helpful even at the\ncost of repetition to sum up what we know in explanation of such\nunfulfilled predictions. They are to be explained sometimes by\nuncertainty as to the beginning of pregnancy, as for example by the\nsupposition that conception took place shortly after the last\nmenstrual period, whereas it actually occurred two or three weeks\nlater. In a few instances, however, errors of observation or of\ncalculation will not account for false predictions.\n\nIt is generally admitted that second pregnancies average somewhat\nlonger than first pregnancies; one series of statistics indicates\nthat the duration increases slightly with each pregnancy up to the\nninth and decreases after that. Pregnancy is protracted more\nfrequently in healthy women than in those who are not, and again more\nfrequently in those who are inactive than in those who work. With\ntwins, contrary to the popular belief, pregnancy is apt to end\nbefore, not after, the expected date. The sex of the child, in all\nprobability, has no influence upon the duration of pregnancy.\n\nAs we might expect, individuality is also a factor in this problem.\nThus, the period of gestation with some women is regularly longer,\nwith others habitually shorter than the accepted average. Until\nexperience has demonstrated their existence, generally, such\npeculiarities are overlooked. But occasionally they may be detected\nfrom knowledge of the interval between the menstrual periods; an\nunusually long interval between them, for example, would lead us to\nanticipate a protracted pregnancy.\n\nAny delay after the expected date of birth has arrived taxes the\npatience of the prospective mother. The fact, however, that more than\n280 days have passed since the last menstruation, does not\nnecessarily mean that a patient has gone \"over time.\" Such a question\ncan be decided solely from the weight and length of the child. Judged\nin this way, comprehensive statistics indicate that once in several\nhundred cases pregnancy may be fairly called prolonged. Even in these\nrare instances an examination about the time of the predicted date\nmakes it clear whether pregnancy should be artificially ended or be\nallowed to proceed to its natural conclusion.",

        "content": "THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OVUM\n\nThe Germinal Cells--Fertilization--The First Steps in Development--\nThe Reaction of the Uterus--The Amniotic Fluid--The Placenta--The\nUmbilical Cord.\n\nPregnancy, besides changing the external form of the body, causes\nsensations--as for example those due to fetal movements--which are so\ndistinctive that they cannot escape notice. These obvious evidences\nof approaching motherhood naturally lead thoughtful women to wonder\nabout the hidden mechanism of development, a mechanism which, of\nitself, causes no sensation whatever. It is for this reason, perhaps,\nthat a prospective mother's imagination is so apt to be unusually\nactive, often picturing absurd conditions as responsible for one\nsymptom or another. Those who give free play to the imagination in\nregard to the formation and progress of the embryo are pretty certain\nto arrive at erroneous if not grotesque conclusions; for example,\nthey may attribute a protracted pregnancy to the child's having grown\nfast to the mother, a situation that cannot arise.\n\nOf course it is not essential that a prospective mother should\nunderstand what is happening within the womb. And upon those who\nprefer to be ignorant of the mechanism of development I would not\nurge another point of view, for not ignorance but the unchallenged\nacceptance of \"half-truths\" and of totally incorrect explanations is\nthe chief source of harm. On the other hand, my own experience has\ntaught me that women who wish to know about development should be\ntold the truth. In accord with this is the fact that I never have\nmore satisfactory patients than those who have previously been\ntrained nurses and who, in preparing for that profession, received\ninstruction concerning the reproductive function of human beings.\n\nA description of development, in order to be perfectly clear, must\nbegin with a word about the fundamental structure of the adult body.\nEveryone knows that the various parts of the body perform different\nfunctions; but not everyone, perhaps, realizes that, in spite of\ntheir different functions, all the organs of the body are composed of\nsimilar structural units, known as cells. Of course, cells are\ndefinitely arranged according to the use for which the tissue that\nthey chance to compose may be designed; they have, moreover,\ndistinctive individual peculiarities which can be easily recognized\nunder the microscope; but the essential features of the cells remain\nthe same, wherever they may be located. That is to say, each cell is\na minute portion of living matter, or protoplasm, separated from its\nneighbors by a partition, the cell-membrane; each has its own seat of\ngovernment, the nucleus, located near its center; and each, to all\nintents and purposes, leads an individual existence.\n\nTHE GERMINAL CELLS.--Many of the cells in the human body are able to\nproduce others of their kind. This they do virtually by growing and\nsplitting in half; cell-division, as this splitting is called, really\nrepresents reproduction reduced to the simplest terms. Most cells can\ndo no more than produce units like themselves. The bodies of women\ncontain, however, a type of cell which possesses a far more wonderful\npower. Provided the requisite conditions for such development are\nmet, these cells are capable of developing into human beings. Each of\nthese remarkable units is called an Ovum, or egg-cell, and represents\none variety of the germinal cells. But the other variety, represented\nby the Spermatozoon and developed only in the male sex, is also\nrequired for the production of a human being.\n\nEvery ovum originates in the ovaries. These are organs peculiar to\nwomen, having the size and shape of large almonds, and placed in the\nlower part of the abdominal cavity. Though the ovaries are two in\nnumber, one alone is sufficient for every requirement of health. It\nhas been estimated that the ovaries together contain at the time of\nbirth about 40,000 ova, distributed equally between them. Since less\nthan 500 ova are required to insure regularity in the menstrual\nfunction, it is clear that, if the surgeon finds it necessary to\nremove one of the ovaries, the other will provide abundantly for\nmenstruation and for the bearing of children. Although every ovum\nthat will be produced as long as a woman lives has already sprung\ninto existence by the time she is born, not a single one ripens for\nfrom twelve to fifteen years. The ripening process begins about the\ntime of puberty, and, unless suspended through the occurrence of\npregnancy, continues until the menopause. During this period, which\nis also characterized by the periodical appearance of menstruation,\none ovum ripens each month; sometimes, though rarely, several ripen\nat once, and this tendency is partly responsible for twins.\n\nThe human ovum is a tiny structure, measuring about 1/125 of an inch\nin diameter. With the naked eye it can barely be seen; magnified by\nthe microscope it appears as a little round bag made of a transparent\nmembrane. Briefly described, the ovum is a single cell. That is, it\nbelongs to the simplest class of anatomical structures, and is one of\nthe millions upon millions of units that make up the body. It\ncontains a nucleus surrounded by nutritive material, the yolk. Yet\nthe quantity of yolk is exceedingly small. In this particular the\nhuman ovum differs notably from the egg of birds, as it does also in\nthat it lacks a shell. Obviously, a shell would not only be useless\nto an embryo developing within the body of its parent, but would shut\noff the nourishment, which, since the ovum contains so little, must\nnecessarily be provided by the mother.\n\nWhen the ovum has ripened, it becomes detached from the ovary, and\nenters a fleshy tube about the size of a lead pencil, known as the\noviduct. There are two of these tubes, one running from the\nneighborhood of each ovary; both enter the uterus, but on opposite\nsides. The ovum travels down the tube which corresponds to the ovary\nwhere it originated. The journey is fraught with momentous\nconsequences, for it is during this passage through the oviduct that\nthe fate of the ovum is determined. If it is to develop into a living\ncreature, a great many conditions must sooner or later be fulfilled;\nbut there is one which must be promptly satisfied. Shortly after\nleaving the ovary the ovum must receive the stimulus to live and\ngrow; otherwise it will quickly wither and die. This vital stimulus\ncan be imparted only by the spermatozoon.\n\nThe male germinal cell is like the female cell in the possession of a\nnucleus; in other respects it is very different. Longer but much\nnarrower than the ovum, the tiny arrow-shaped spermatozoon is\nparticularly distinguished by its active motility, for it has a tail\nthat propels it. The human male cell must travel some distance to\nreach the point where it can meet a ripe and vigorous ovum; and since\nthe journey is not without danger to its life, Nature has provided\nthat exceedingly large numbers of the male cells shall be deposited\nin the vagina at the time of the marital relation. In this way, it is\nmade sure that some of them will travel up through the uterus and\noviducts, arriving in the neighborhood of the ovaries.\n\nFERTILIZATION.--Convincing observations upon the lower forms of life,\nespecially upon fishes, have shown that when the germinal cells come\nnear to each other, the ovum attracts the spermatozoon. The power of\nattraction which the ovum exerts may be likened, most simply, to the\ninfluence of a magnet upon iron-filings. While there has been no\nopportunity to observe such attraction between the parent cells of\nhuman beings, its existence is not open to doubt. And it is\npractically certain that these cells meet in the oviduct, even in\nthat portion of it which receives the ovum just as it leaves the\novary. Thither a number of the male cells have traveled by their own\nactivity; several come in contact with the ovum and one, but only\none, actually enters it. Almost at the moment when they touch, the\ntwo cells unite so intimately that all trace of the spermatozoon is\nlost. Fertilization of the ovum, as this event is scientifically\ntermed, has as its main purpose the uniting of the nucleus of a male\ngerminal cell with the nucleus of the female germinal cell. This\ndetail has been carefully studied; we know that the nuclei quickly\nblend into one, and that the particles of living matter contributed\nby the male animate the female cell with a new and wonderful\nactivity.\n\nIn our every-day way of speaking, fertilization means conception; it\nis the instant in which a living being begins its existence. There is\nno longer the slightest excuse for confusion regarding the period at\nwhich the life of the unborn child begins. Before the significance of\nfertilization was understood, it was perhaps not unreasonable to\nbelieve that life began with quickening or about the time the fetal\nheart-sounds could be heard. But now we must acknowledge that both\nthese ideas were incorrect. The animation of the ovum at the moment\nof conception marks the beginning of growth and development which\nconstitutes its right to be considered as a human being.\n\nIndividuality, hereditary traits, sex--all these, we may be sure--are\nunalterably determined from the moment of conception. The germinal\ncell forms the total contribution of the male parent to pregnancy;\ntherefore no other opportunity for him to influence his progeny\npresents itself, and the substance which enters the ovum at the time\nof fertilization must be the basis of inheritance from the father. It\nis equally true, as we shall see in the next chapter, that the\nnucleus of the ovum and the nucleus alone transmits maternal\nqualities. The material which conveys inheritable characters can be\nseen and has been identified in both germinal cells; from each of\nthem the fertilized ovum derives equal amounts. As the parental\nnuclei unite, the material which they contain intermingles and\nestablishes a new being; to attain full development, it requires\nnothing further from the father, and nothing save nourishment from\nthe mother.\n\nTHE FIRST STEPS IN DEVELOPMENT.--Although the identity of the\nspermatozoon is lost at the moment of fertilization, its influence\njust then begins to be asserted. In the fertilized ovum the dawn of\ndevelopment is shown at first by unusual activity within and later by\nalterations upon the surface. Before very long the circumference of\nthe cell becomes indented as if a knife had been drawn around it, and\nshortly two cells appear in place of one. These two cells in turn\ndivide, yielding four cells which grow and divide into eight. In this\nmanner division follows division until a multitude of cells have\nsprung into existence, all of which cling together in the shape of a\nball. Development always proceeds in the same orderly way; evidently\nit is governed by fixed laws which decree that the mass shall remain\nfor a while in the form of a ball, though the ball, at first solid,\nsoon becomes hollow.\n\nWhile these changes are taking place the growing ovum is carried down\nthe oviduct a distance of four to six inches and finally comes to\nrest in the uterus, where it is to dwell during the months necessary\nto its complete development. The time consumed by this journey cannot\nbe measured accurately; it may be as short as a few hours or as long\nas several days, but in all probability it is never longer than a\nweek. Although the element of time is uncertain the method of\ntransmission is well understood. Of its own accord the ovum can move\nafter fertilization no better than before; it is never capable of\nmoving itself. The active agent of transportation is the oviduct,\nwhich has been fitted for this purpose with millions of short, hair-\nlike structures that project into its interior. These are closely set\nupon the inner surface of the oviduct; their outer ends are free and\ncontinually sway to and fro like a wheat field on a windy day; and by\ntheir motion they create a current in the direction in which the ovum\nshould move, namely, toward the uterus. While passing through the\noviduct, the ovum has no attachment whatever to the mother, yet\ndevelopment is going on all the time. It is thus made perfectly clear\nthat development is not directed by the parent. This independence of\nthe parent, though it continues to be one of the characteristic\nfeatures of the development of the ovum, shortly becomes less\nevident, for communication is set up between the mother and the ovum\nas soon as it reaches the uterus. Unless we were warned, we might\neasily misinterpret the significance of this attachment to the\nparent. It does not permit the mother, for instance, to influence the\nmind or character which the child will have. The purpose of the\nattachment is twofold, namely, to anchor the ovum, and to arrange\nchannels by which, on the one hand, nutriment may reach the embryo,\nand, on the other, its waste products may return to the mother. The\nmother may influence the nutrition of the fetus; but she cannot\ndetermine the kind of brain or liver her child will have; neither for\nthat matter can she alter the development of any portion of the\nembryo.\n\nAfter its entrance into the cavity of the uterus prepared to receive\nand protect it, the mass of cells sinks into the soft, velvety lining\nof the organ. Here it is entirely surrounded by tissue which belongs\nto the mother. But just before implantation takes place the\narchitecture of the ovum is modified in such a way as to indicate the\ntrend of its subsequent development. We left it, a hollow ball\npassing down the oviduct; had we examined the sphere more closely we\nshould have found its wall composed of a single layer of cells. At\none spot, however, the wall soon thickens. The thickening is due to a\nspecialized group of cells which gradually grows toward the hollow\ncenter of the ball. A little later, if we study the structure as a\nwhole, we find it a small, distended sac, from the inner surface of\nwhich hangs a tiny clump of tissue. The clump of cells within and the\ninclosing sac as well are both requisite to the ultimate object of\npregnancy; yet they fulfill very different purposes. The clump within\nwill mold itself into the embryo; the inclosing sac will make\npossible the continued existence and growth of the embryo by securing\nand conveying to it nourishment according to its needs. These two\nstructures, which from now on constitute the ovum, can best be\nconsidered separately and in the order of their development. We shall\ntherefore first study the sac and in the next chapter the embryo.\n\nFor a time after this sac, or ball, as you may choose to think of it,\nbecomes implanted in the uterus, every part of its wall shares in the\nresponsibility of procuring nourishment for the embryo. On this\naccount the wall, or capsule, is for several weeks the most\nconspicuous part of the ovum. Its position is naturally advantageous,\nfor, since it forms the outermost region of the structure and comes\ninto immediate contact with the tissues of the mother, it has the\nfirst opportunity to seize and appropriate nutriment. Consequently,\nwhile there is still relatively little development in the embryo, the\ncapsule of the ovum gives evidence of rapid extension; the wall\nbecomes thicker, and the circumference of the sac increases. The\nsignificant thing about this growth, however, is the fact that it\ndoes not progress evenly. At some points cell-division is more active\nthan at others, with the result that the surface of the ovum speedily\nloses its smooth, regular outline. Projections from the capsule\nappear; they increase in number and in length; and by the end of four\nweeks the ovum, as yet less than an inch in diameter, resembles a\nminiature chestnut-burr. To make the comparison more accurate, we\nmust imagine such a burr covered with limp threads instead of rigid\nspines.\n\nThese projections, the so-called Villi, push their way into the\nmucous membrane of the uterus and serve a two-fold purpose. One of\ntheir functions is to fix the ovum in its new abode; and, though the\nattachment is not at first very secure, it becomes stronger in the\ncourse of time and is capable of withstanding whatever tendency the\nactivity of daily life may have to loosen it. The other, and equally\nimportant, task of the villi, the majority of which dip into the\nmother's blood, is to transmit substances to and from the embryo.\n\nWe have traced thus far the earliest steps in the development of the\novum. One portion, we observed, was promptly set apart for the\nconstruction of the future child; this favored portion became\ninclosed by all the rest of the ovum, which has a more or less\nspherical form and is technically called the fetal sac. The first\nduty of the sac is to take root in the womb, and the second, no less\nvital, is to draw nourishment from the mother. But neither of these\nfunctions can be performed without the participation of the uterine\nmucous membrane, the soil, as it were, in which the ovum is planted.\nWe must now learn how the maternal tissues assume the responsibility\nplaced upon them.\n\nTHE REACTION OF THE UTERUS.--The womb, which is small before\nmarriage, is converted by pregnancy into the largest organ of the\nbody. The virginal uterus, shaped somewhat like a pear, and placed\nwith apex downward, is carefully protected within the bony basin\nbetween the hips, which is commonly called the Pelvis. The upper and\nlarger part of the organ, known as the body, lies at the bottom of\nthe abdominal cavity; the lower part, the neck, projects into the\nvagina. The cavity inside the womb communicates above with the two\noviducts and terminates below in a canal which runs through the neck\nand opens into the vagina by an orifice known as the mouth of the\nwomb.\n\nPregnancy modifies every portion of the womb in one way or another;\nbut the most profound alterations occur in the body, in the cavity of\nwhich the ovum has come to rest. During the forty weeks of gestation\nthe organ grows in weight from two ounces to as many pounds; from\nthree inches in length it increases to fifteen inches; and its\ncapacity is multiplied 500 times.\n\nThe mucous membrane which lines the cavity of the uterus responds to\nthe stimulus of pregnancy in a characteristic manner and with a\nsingle purpose, namely, to promote the development of the ovum. In\nconnection with menstruation we noted that this membrane periodically\nprepares for the reception of an ovum. And if the expected ovum has\nbeen fertilized, its arrival is followed by arrangements for its\nprotection and nutrition which are far more elaborate than the\npreparations for its reception. Within a few weeks the mucous\nmembrane becomes half an inch thick, that is, about ten times thicker\nthan it was; and all the elements entering into its composition,\nbecome unusually active. The blood-vessels are congested; the glands\npour out a more elaborate secretion; and certain cells lay up a\nbountiful store of material to be drawn upon in the formation of the\nembryo and the building up of the structures that promote its\ndevelopment.\n\nThe ovum is as likely to find a resting place at one spot as another\nupon the surface of the uterine mucous membrane. The whole of that\nsurface has been made ready to receive it; yet the area actually\nrequired to imbed the tiny object is extremely small. As the ovum\nescapes from the oviduct and enters the womb, it is smaller, in all\nprobability, than the head of a pin. For at least a week after its\ncoming, diligent search is necessary to find the site of\nimplantation. Insignificant as it is at first, however, the region of\nimplantation later becomes very prominent, for it undergoes a\ntransformation that the rest of the mucous membrane does not share.\nThat is to say, it becomes the point of attachment of the Placenta,\nan organ that has the very important function of drawing upon the\nresources of the mother's blood. As the ovum sinks into this\nespecially prepared bed, the villi are formed. They break open the\nadjacent capillaries of the mother, thus diverting her blood from its\naccustomed course. The blood collects in microscopic lakes in contact\nwith the capsule of the ovum, and from them flows back into the\nmother's veins. Through the veins it returns to her heart, by which\nit is distributed through the arteries to the various regions of the\nbody. The tiny lakes, in which the villi hang, are thus made a part\nof the mother's circulation and as such are regularly replenished\nwith purified blood. By this means the ovum receives a rich supply of\nnutriment, and as a natural consequence its growth is rapid.\n\nBefore very long the diameter of the ovum is greater than the depth\nof the mucous membrane which surrounds it. Consequently that part of\nthe membrane which covers it is pushed into the uterine cavity, as\nthe ground is raised by a sprouting seed. Growth continues, the\nbulging increases, and extensive alterations are wrought both in the\nwomb and in the capsule of the ovum. One of these alterations will be\nmore easily understood if we still think of the ovum as a seed, for\nit grows away from its roots just as plants do. Most of the capsule,\ntherefore, is removed step by step farther from its source of\nnourishment, for the maternal blood-vessels do not follow the\nexpanding sac but retain their original position at its base. Partly\non account of the lack of nutriment thus occasioned and partly on\naccount of the distention caused by the contents of the sac, atrophy\noccurs in the distant portions of the sac's wall. As a final result\nof these two factors, the maternal tissue which covers the ovum\nbecomes thinned and stretched; it is pushed entirely across the\nuterine cavity; and by about the twentieth week meets the opposite\nside of the cavity, to which it becomes adherent. Subsequently, the\nsac which incloses the embryo becomes everywhere fastened to the\ninner surface of the uterus and completely fills the uterine cavity.\n\nTHE AMNIOTIC FLUID.--The great enlargement of the uterus which is so\nmarked a characteristic of the latter part of pregnancy is due in a\nmeasure to the luxuriant blood-supply, for better nutrition always\ncauses growth. In a far larger measure, however, it is due to\ndistention for which the product of conception is responsible. Beside\nthe fetus the inclosing sac also contains a considerable quantity of\nfluid. This fluid, called \"The Waters\" by those who have no special\nknowledge of anatomy, is technically designated as the Amniotic\nFluid.\n\nIn the earlier months of pregnancy the amniotic fluid is not\nabundant; later it increases rapidly, so that by the end of the\nperiod it measures about a quart, and frequently even more. The\nslightly yellow amniotic fluid is itself clear, but small particles\nof dead skin and other material cast off from the surface of the\nchild's body are floating in it, and may cause turbidity. The absence\nof odor supports the view that this fluid is not the child's urine.\nThe evidence thus far adduced, though not absolutely conclusive,\ngives good reason to believe that \"the waters\" are secreted by the\ninner side of the sac which incloses the fetus. Very early in\npregnancy this sac becomes a double-walled structure; and, though its\nlayers are intimately blended, and together measure not more than\n1/16 of an inch in thickness, with a little care they can be\nseparated. The outer layer, which comes in contact with the inner\nsurface of the uterus and has to do with the matter of nutrition, is\ncalled the Chorionic Membrane; the inner, the so-called Amniotic\nMembrane, is much the stronger and is devoted to the protection of\nthe embryo, which it completely surrounds with fluid, at the same\ntime retaining the fluid within set bounds.\n\nThe amniotic fluid performs many important duties. Perhaps the first,\nin point of time, is to provide sufficient room for the embryo to\ngrow in. Later, as the fluid increases, it permits the fetus to move\nfreely, and yet renders the movements less noticeable to the mother.\nAgain, the amniotic fluid prevents injuries that might otherwise\nbefall the child in case the mother wears her clothing too tight.\nHarmful as the practice of tight-lacing during pregnancy is, it does\nnot, thanks to the presence of the amniotic fluid, result in the\ndisfigurement of the child. For the same reason a blow struck upon\nthe abdomen, as in a fall forward, is not so serious as might be\nthought, since the fluid, not the child, receives the force of the\nimpact. Some physicians believe that the fetus swallows the amniotic\nfluid and thus secures nourishment. The fluid also serves to keep the\nfetus warm; or, to be more exact, protects it from sudden changes in\nthe temperature of the mother's environment. Normally the temperature\nof the fetus is thus kept nearly one degree higher than the\ntemperature of the parent.\n\nUltimately, the amniotic fluid assists in dilating the mouth of the\nwomb, which remains closed until the beginning of the process that\nterminates with birth. The uterine contractions at the onset of labor\ncompress the fluid; in turn the fluid attempts to escape but is held\nin check by the amniotic membrane, which it drives into the canal\nleading from the uterine cavity to the vagina. Acting like a wedge,\nthe fluid gradually pushes the mouth of the womb wider and wider\nopen, until it is large enough for the child to pass. The sac usually\nruptures when that point is reached, the fluid escapes, and in due\ntime the child is born. This is followed within half an hour by the\nextrusion of a mass of tissue--in reality the collapsed fetal sac--\nwhich in every language, so far as I know, is named the After-Birth.\nAn examination of this tissue at the time of delivery repays the\nphysician, for it is important to ascertain that none of it has been\nleft in the uterus. Our interest at present, however, is to learn how\nthe after-birth has assisted toward the growth of the child.\n\nTHE PLACENTA.--The after-birth has puzzled scientists as well as the\nlaity, and not until comparatively recent times have its origin,\nstructure, and use been satisfactorily explained. Its meaning\nprofoundly interested primitive men and stimulated their imagination\nscarcely less than the mystery of conception. Some uncivilized tribes\nbelieved that the after-birth was animated like the child;\nconsequently they spoke of it as \"the other half,\" and often saved it\nto give to the child in case of sickness. But generally the after-\nbirth was buried with religious ceremony, and was occasionally\nunearthed later to discover whether the woman would have other\nchildren; the prophecy was made according to the manner of\ndisintegration or some other equally absurd circumstance.\n\nThe after-birth consists of a round, fleshy cake, the placenta, to\nwhich two very essential structures are attached. One of these,\nrunning from one surface of the cake, is a rope-like appendage, the\numbilical cord, which links the placenta with the fetus. The other,\nattached to the circular edge of the cake, is a thin veil of tissue,\nin some part of which a rent will be found. Now, if we lift the\nmargin of the rent, we shall see that the veil and the cake together\nform a sac which we are holding by the opening. This aperture through\nwhich the fetus passed, and it was really made for that purpose, was\nformerly placed over the mouth of the womb; the sac itself, distended\nby the fetus and the amniotic fluid, was fastened everywhere to the\ninner surface of the womb.\n\nIt is plain that we have now in our hands the fetal sac, the\ndevelopment of which we have already traced from the beginning. The\nwall of the sac, it will be recalled, was originally of the same\nformation throughout; but when the ovum became imbedded in the womb,\nthat part of its capsule which remained in permanent contact with the\nmother's blood underwent special development, whereas the rest of the\ncapsule gradually pushed away from its primary position and, becoming\nstunted in its growth, even lost to some degree the development it\nhad attained. This latter portion, the veil that passes from the edge\nof the placenta, is formed of the two membranes we have mentioned,\nnamely, the chorion and the amnion.\n\nThe placenta is, for the most part, a highly developed portion of the\nchorionic membrane, which became specialized simply because it\nhappened to receive the best supply of blood. At the time of birth\nthe placenta measures nearly an inch in thickness, is as large around\nas a breakfast-plate, and generally weighs a pound and a quarter,\nthat is, approximately one-sixth of the weight of the child. This\nrelation between the weight of the placenta and of the child is\nregularly maintained; therefore, the larger the child the larger the\nplacenta associated with it.\n\nThe placenta has two surfaces, easily distinguished from each other.\nThe raw maternal surface was formerly attached to the inside of the\nuterus; the fetal surface, covered by the amniotic membrane, was in\ncontact with the amniotic fluid. Across the fetal surface run a\nnumber of blood-vessels containing the child's blood, converging\ntoward a central point at which the umbilical cord is inserted. The\npoint at which the cord is attached affords the simplest means of\ndistinguishing the two surfaces of the placenta.\n\nOur knowledge as to how the exchange of food and excretory products\nbetween mother and child is carried on by the placenta has been\ngained chiefly through the microscope. The oldest medical writings,\nas we might suppose, express very fanciful ideas regarding the nature\nof embryonic development and the means by which it is made possible;\nno rational view of these matters could exist until the circulation\nof the blood was described by William Harvey in 1628. After this\nepoch-making revelation, it was accepted as true that the mother's\nblood entered the unborn child and returned to her own system. But\nthat view eventually became untenable, for it was proved conclusively\nthat there is no communicating channel between the two. For years\nafter that, it was believed that before birth the womb manufactured\nmilk to sustain the child, just as the breasts do afterwards; but\nthis theory also was disproved; and, as I have said, only by the use\nof the microscope have we learned the truth about fetal nutrition.\n\nWhen thin slices of the placenta are magnified they are found to\ncontain countless numbers of tiny, finger-like processes; these are\nthe villi, and they constitute the major portion of the organ. The\nvilli seen in a mature placenta are the same as those which projected\nfrom the capsule of the young ovum, but not these alone, for many\nbranches have sprouted from the original projections. The primary\ntrunks with all their branches hang from the capsule of the ovum and\nextract nutriment from the mother's blood which surrounds them, just\nas the roots of a tree extract it from the soil.\n\nThe interchange of material between mother and child as carried on in\nthe placenta can, perhaps, be made clearer if we compare one of the\ntrunks and its branching villi to a human forearm, hand, and fingers.\nThe hand, we will imagine, is held in a basin of water, in which, by\nturning on a spigot and leaving the outflow unstopped, we have\narranged that the water changes constantly. In terms of this\nillustration, the water corresponds to the mother's blood, rich in\noxygen, mineral matter, and all other kinds of essential nutriment;\nand the fingers are the villi. The blood-vessels in the fingers, to\ngo a step farther, represent the blood-vessels which exist within the\nvilli, connecting with the umbilical cord, and passing by that route\nto the body of the child. The blood which thus circulates through the\nvilli, it is important to emphasize, is the child's blood; it cannot\nescape through the coating of the villi, just as our blood cannot\nescape through the skin of the fingers. Similarly, the mother's blood\ncannot enter the child; the two circulations are absolutely separate\nand distinct.\n\nIt must be noticed, moreover, that the maternal blood not only brings\nto the surface of the villi everything the child needs, but it also\ntakes away the waste products of fetal life. Let us select one of the\nfoodstuffs necessary for the unborn child, and follow its course so\nfar as it relates to fetal nutrition. The mother's blood brings\nsugar, for example, from her intestinal tract to the surface of the\nvilli; through the coating of the villi the sugar passes into the\nfetal blood, is carried to the fetal heart, and distributed to the\nvarious fetal organs. They burn it, deriving heat and energy, and in\nreturn give off waste products, namely, carbonic acid gas and water,\nwhich are taken up by the fetal blood, borne back to the placenta,\nand pass again through the coating of the villi into the mother's\ncirculation. These waste products are then transported to the\nmother's lungs and to her kidneys, and are finally thrown off from\nher body. Before the child is born, therefore, the placenta, which is\nan aggregation of villi, acts as its stomach, intestines, lungs, and\nkidneys.\n\nIn every pregnancy the placenta serves in this way as an organ of\nnutrition, arranging for the passage of food from the mother's blood\nto the fetal circulation. Occasionally, it is interesting to observe,\nthe placenta performs a very different function, namely, the\nprotection of the unborn child from diseases that may attack the\nmother. It is able to afford such protection, because the coating of\nthe villi is not permeable to all sorts of substances. In order to\npass through their walls, material must be in solution; solid bodies,\ntherefore, are denied admission to the fetal circulation. The most\nsignificant result of this restriction is, perhaps, that so long as\nthe coating of the villi remains intact and healthful, bacteria\ncannot gain access to the unborn child. Since in health there are no\nbacteria in the mother's blood, this fact has no bearing upon the\naverage pregnancy; but in those exceptional cases in which typhoid\nfever or some other infectious disease appears during pregnancy, it\nis gratifying to know that Nature has provided an unusual defense\nagainst infection of the unborn child.\n\nThat we do not know all about the interchange of substances between\nmother and child must be admitted; but the essential facts, and they\nalone are of interest here, have been established beyond contention.\nThere is no doubt whatever that the mother's blood surrounds the\nplacental villi but never enters the child. The fetal blood, on the\nother hand, is first in the child's body, then in the villi, and then\nreturns to the child again. It never enters the blood-vessels of the\nmother but passes to and from the placenta as long as pregnancy\nlasts.\n\nTHE UMBILICAL CORD.--This rope-like structure, familiarly known as\nthe navel-string, which connects the placenta and the fetus, is\napproximately twenty inches long; its length, therefore, is\nsufficient to permit the newly born child to lie between the mother's\nknees while the placenta remains attached to the womb. The cord is\nabout the thickness of the thumb and contains three blood-vessels,\nall filled with fetal blood; in two of them the current is directed\ntoward the placenta, the third carries the blood back to the fetus\nafter it has circulated through the placental villi. In the cord the\nvessels lie near together and are encased in a jelly-like substance\nthat protects them from injury.\n\nSo far as is known; the umbilical cord performs no service other than\nto link the blood-vessels in the placenta with those in the fetus.\nSimple as this may seem, it is of paramount importance in maintaining\nthe life of the fetus, for compression of the vessels in the cord\nwould shut off its nutriment. Against such accident, however, perfect\nprovisions have been made; both the amniotic fluid and the jelly-like\nsubstance which surrounds the vessels are safeguards which\neffectually protect the circulation from pressure that might\ninterrupt it.\n\nFrequently, prospective mothers are told they must not \"reach up\" for\nfear the cord will become entangled. Such a precaution is quite\nunnecessary. No matter what the mother does, or does not, the cord\nwill be found around the child's neck at the time of birth in one of\nevery three cases. It is not difficult to understand how this\nhappens. The cord is longer than the uterine cavity and must fall in\ncoils toward the bottom of it. Now, since the fetus is free to move\nit enters and withdraws from these loops, many times, in the course\nof pregnancy. Finally, when it takes up a position head downward, as\nit nearly always does, the head is the part of the fetus which passes\nthrough the coil, should one happen to lie in its path. After the\nhead is delivered the physician always feels about the neck to\ndiscover whether a loop of cord is there. If it is, he can release it\neasily. This condition, since it occurs so frequently and since it so\nrarely produces harmful consequences, should not be considered\nunnatural.\n\nAfter the child is born, the physician cuts the cord, and in due time\nthe after-birth is expelled through the same passage as was the\nchild. The expulsion of the after-birth frees the mother of all the\ntissue derived from the growth of the ovum, for the intricate\nmechanism that served to nourish and protect the embryo was almost\nentirely developed from the ovum itself. It is a remarkable provision\nof Nature that very little of the mother's tissue is cast off at the\nend of pregnancy; and even this small portion is promptly replaced.\nBy about the sixth week after delivery, the wound which was made by\nthe separation of the fetal sac has completely healed. Meanwhile the\nmucous membrane that underwent elaborate preparations to receive the\novum, the cavity that was adjusted to its growth, and the muscle\nfibers that were strengthened to insure its safe entry into the world\nhave all regained their original state. Except for the activity of\nthe breasts, the mother is left in the same physical condition as\nbefore she became pregnant.",

        "content": "THE EMBRYO\n\nThe Development of Form--The Determination of Sex--Twins--The Rate\nof Growth--The Newborn Infant--Heredity--Maternal Impressions.\n\nThe new human being begins existence, as I have shown, as soon as the\novum is fertilized, though at that moment it consists merely of a\nsolitary cell formed by the union of the two parental cells. From a\nbeginning relatively simple the human body develops into the most\ncomplex of living structures; and, startling as it may appear to be,\nit is demonstrably true that every one of the millions of cells which\ncompose an adult has descended from the ovum. Furthermore, the\nindividual himself is not the entire progeny of the ovum; the\nplacenta and the membranes dealt with in the preceding chapter, we\nsaw, were also derived from that same source. They possess only a\ntransitory importance, to be sure, and to most persons they are less\ninteresting than the embryo, yet we gave them consideration before\ndiscussing its growth because the manner in which the ovum becomes\nattached to the womb and draws nutriment from the mother primarily\ndetermines the fate of a pregnancy.\n\nNow that we have become familiar with the arrangements for the\nprotection of the embryo, we are prepared to learn how it develops,\nand may accept the phrase, embryonic development, to cover the whole\nperiod of existence within the womb. In a more technical sense,\nhowever, the use of the term _embryo_ is limited to the first\nsix weeks of pregnancy and designates the condition of the young\ncreature before it has acquired the form and the organs of the\ninfant; after that time the unborn child is called a _fetus_.\nEmbryonic development, therefore, in the strictest sense of the term,\nchiefly involves the shifting of various groups of cells and the\nbestowal upon them of different kinds of activity. During this period\ncomparatively slight growth takes place. By about the twentieth week,\nthe house, it may be said, is set in order; and there follows a\nperiod marked by the rapid growth of the fetus.\n\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF FORM.--A very old explanation of embryonic\ndevelopment was that the process consisted altogether in growth.\nAccording to that view the embryo lay curled up in the egg; at the\noutset it was equipped with organs, limbs, features, and all the\nother bodily structures found in an adult. In order that the ovum\nmight be transformed into a mature infant, only unfolding and growth\nwere required. After the microscope came into use, however, so simple\nan explanation could no longer be accepted. Scientists soon realized\nthat the embryo did not exist \"ready made\" in the ovum, which, even\nwhen magnified, failed to bear the faintest likeness to a human\nbeing.\n\nAlthough the microscope made impossible this very simple explanation,\nit gave in return a truer, if more complex, account of the\ntransformation from egg to offspring. By this means it has been\ndefinitely proved that the ovum multiplies rapidly after it has been\nfertilized, and becomes, as was explained in the preceding chapter, a\nsac-like structure within which hangs a tiny clump of tissue. This\ninner mass of cells forms the embryo.\n\nIt has proved a difficult task to secure very young human embryos,\nand many of the ideas we hold relative to the initial stages in the\ndevelopment of man are based upon what has been found true in certain\nmammals, the class of animals to which we belong. The youngest human\novum known at present has already undergone about two weeks'\ndevelopment, and there the embryo is represented by a flat disk. From\nthis stage to the stage of complete development a satisfactory series\nof embryos has now been collected, but it is impossible to give here,\neven in outline, a description of the evolution of the human embryo.\nNo one can understand this intricate subject without the aid of\ndiagrams, models, and other material beyond the reach of all save\nlaboratory workers.\n\nBy the end of the second month the development of the embryo has\nadvanced so far that anyone could recognize its human shape. About\nthat time, too, the external sexual organs make their appearance. At\nfirst these are quite similar in both sexes; and, if they are used as\nthe criterion, it is possible only toward the end of the third month\nto say whether the embryo is a male or female.\n\nTHE DETERMINATION OF SEX.--The fact that a number of months pass\nbefore the sex can be distinguished by an external examination of the\nfetus has led to the erroneous belief that it can be influenced\nduring the early part of pregnancy or actually determined at will.\nVarious means to accomplish this have been suggested; many of them\ndepend upon modifying the mother's mode of living according as a boy\nor girl is desired. The most widely known of these doctrines, that of\nSchenck, was to the effect that the sex of the offspring is always\nthat of the weaker parent. He suggested, therefore, that increasing\nthe vigor of the mother by an appropriate diet would produce a male\nchild, whereas a decrease in her strength would lead to the opposite\nresult. His views, however, were incorrect. After studying extensive\nstatistics Newcomb came to the conclusion that \"it is in the highest\ndegree unlikely that there is any way by which a parent can affect\nthe sex of his or her offspring.\"\n\nMoreover, the results of experimental research clearly indicate that\nwe shall never possess the means by which a mother may control the\nsex of her child. In the main laboratory investigations have sought\nto answer two questions. First, at what time is the sex of the\noffspring determined? and, second, what accounts for the origin of a\nmale in one instance and of a female in another? The study of these\nproblems has been carried on chiefly in connection with insects,\nworms, and fowl; but as yet insurmountable difficulties have\nprevented similar investigations in higher animals. For this reason,\nit is not without the greatest caution that results thus far obtained\nmay be assumed to apply to man.\n\nSufficient facts, however, have been collected to admit no doubt\nregarding the answer to the first question. In most animals it is\ndefinitely known that the sex of the offspring has been fixed when\nthe male cell enters the female cell, in other words, at the instant\nthe ovum is fertilized. Excellent reasons exist for believing that\nhuman beings conform to this rule, and that the sex of the child is\nunalterably determined at the moment conception occurs. Consequently,\nany attempt to influence it after that event must prove futile.\n\nFor the present, the second question cannot be answered with equal\nassurance. More than five hundred theories have been offered to\nexplain the relation of sex; nearly all of them have no reasonable\nfoundation and are only of historical interest. The view that girls\nare derived from the right ovary, boys from the left, has long since\nbeen disproven, and deserves mention merely because the laity still\nbelieve it. Happily, during the last few years, observations and\nexperiments have been made which greatly advance our knowledge of the\nsubject and give promise of an early solution of the problem. The\ncontrolling factor in sex determination has been narrowed down to\nthree possibilities; it is inherited either from the single cell\ncontributed by the father or from the single cell contributed by the\nmother, or it is determined by the effect these two cells have upon\neach other at the moment when they unite. In most animal species the\nweight of authority distinctly favors placing the whole\nresponsibility upon the male cell.\n\nAccording to recent evidence, there are two kinds of male germinal\ncells; one kind giving rise to female offspring and the other to\nmale. In all probability, at the time of the marital relation, these\nvarieties are deposited in the vagina in equal numbers; and,\nmoreover, the mode of their production is such as to place absolutely\nbeyond human control the possibility of changing this ratio. Since\nonly one spermatozoon enters the ovum, whether or not the child will\nbe a boy or a girl depends entirely upon which type gains entrance.\nIf this explanation is correct, and it is in accord with careful\nbiological observations, it removes from the mother all\nresponsibility for the sex of her child. Furthermore, since the facts\nindicate that male-producing and female-producing spermatozoa are\npresent in equal numbers, it follows that practically there is an\neven chance that an embryo will develop into a boy or a girl.\n\nBirth statistics bear out this conclusion, as data gathered from many\ncountries indicate that when long periods of time are studied 105\nboys are born with a surprising regularity for every 100 girls. Thus,\nthe records of Berlin, Germany, for a hundred years show that the\nmaximum difference occurred in 1820, when the males outnumbered the\nfemales by 4.79 per cent.; the minimum difference, which was noted in\n1835, was .64 per cent. in favor of boys.\n\nNo inquiry is more often submitted to the physician by prospective\nmothers than this, \"Can you tell me if my baby will be a boy or a\ngirl?\" He cannot. Many rules, to be sure, have been advocated as safe\nguides toward reaching the correct answer; every midwife possesses\nher individual formula which she has \"never known to fail.\" But the\nboastful success depends upon the application of some such method as\nthe following, which I have heard my teacher, Dr. J. Whitridge\nWilliams, expose to his classes. The patient is asked if a boy or\ngirl is desired. She confesses, and is then informed that the sex of\nher child will be the opposite of her wish. When this guess proves to\nbe correct, there is no doubt of the prophet's wisdom; when it is\nnot, his honor is protected, for the parents have had their hope\nfulfilled. Their happiness makes them forgetful that the guess was\nwrong, or, for that matter, that it was ever made.\n\nIt was once believed that the sexes might be distinguished before\nbirth by the number of heart beats occurring within a minute. In a\ngeneral way, the action of this organ in females is somewhat more\nrapid than in males; and so it was thought that a rate of 144 or more\nindicated the female and a rate of 124 or less the male sex. But\nexperience has taught that this rule leads to accurate prophecy in no\nmore than half of the cases. As a matter of fact, no means of\ndefinitely foretelling the sex of the child has been discovered, and\nI doubt if it ever can be.\n\nTWINS.--As every one knows, pregnancy commonly terminates with the\nbirth of a single child. Twins appear in approximately only one of\nninety pregnancies, while triplets are extremely rare. It is true\nthat even quintuplets may occur, though up to 1904 only 29 authentic\ninstances could be collected from the whole range of medical\nliterature.\n\nTwins are most frequently born to parents whose ancestors have\nestablished this tendency; the trait is usually inherited from the\nmother's family, though occasionally it is passed on through the\nfather. Of course, that does not explain the cause of twins, which in\nreality may result from either of two circumstances. More commonly\ntheir genesis depends upon the ripening of two eggs at about the same\ntime and the fertilization of both by two different spermatozoa. The\nchildren, in this instance known as double ovum twins, may be of the\nsame sex or not. On the other hand, single ovum, or identical, twins\nare always of the same sex; this follows, since but one egg and but\none spermatozoon are here concerned. The incident permitting twins to\ndevelop from a solitary ovum must occur soon after conception has\ntaken place. It will be remembered that the first step in the\ndevelopment of the fertilized ovum consists in its dividing into two\ncells. Ordinarily, both these take part in the development of one\nembryo, but occasionally they separate and give rise to two.\nFrequently, the presence of twins can be recognized during the latter\nmonths of pregnancy, and accurate means are known of determining\nafter they are born to which variety any given pair belongs.\n\nTHE RATE OF GROWTH.--When we recall the definite and often marked\ndifferences in the physical character of women, such as weight and\nheight, it is surprising to learn that the prenatal development of\ntheir children proceeds with uniform speed. One very practical result\nis that the physician is thus enabled, at the birth of a premature\ninfant, to estimate accurately the period of its development. Various\ncriteria, some of which are easy of application, aid in this\ndetermination. For example, the length of the child is practically\nconstant for each of the ten lunar months into which the whole\ngestation period is divided; if, therefore, the length of the newborn\ninfant is known, the stage of its development can always be inferred.\nFrom the fifth month the calculation is especially simple, since the\nlength measured in centimeters divided by the figure 5 gives the\nmonth to which pregnancy has advanced. Similarly, we can infer the\nperiod of development from the weight, though the calculation is more\nintricate and the method less reliable, inasmuch as the size of the\nchild in the latter months varies somewhat according to the weight of\nits mother.\n\nAt the end of the fifth month, the weight of the fetus is from nine\nto ten ounces; whereas an average infant when born at the expiration\nof the full term of pregnancy, that is, with the completion of the\ntenth month, weighs about seven pounds. The fetus, therefore,\nacquires roundly ninety per cent, of its weight during the second\nhalf of pregnancy, which clearly indicates that Nature reserves this\nperiod of gestation for the fetus to increase in size, a phenomenon\nless mysterious but no less important than the evolution of the\nembryo.\n\nNothing is more valuable than the weight in affording an indication\nas to whether a prematurely born infant may be reared. It is unusual\nto raise a child weighing less than four pounds, which corresponds\napproximately to the end of the eighth lunar month of development (a\ntrifle more than the seventh calendar month). After this time, the\nprospect of living becomes greater in proportion to the nearness with\nwhich the infant has approached maturity. No truth exists in the\nwidespread belief that the seventh-month child is favored above that\nborn later but before the natural end of pregnancy. Experience has\ntaught that the probability of success in rearing the child increases\nrapidly after the seventh month. This is reasonable on the following\nsomewhat theoretical grounds. The digestive organs later attain a\nhigher state of perfection, and are better prepared to carry on their\nwork satisfactorily. Moreover, the gradual deposition of fat beneath\nthe skin during the last two months of pregnancy materially assists\nin fitting the child for the conditions met with in the external\nworld, since the fat affords a barrier against the escape of heat\ngenerated within the body, making it much easier to keep the child's\ntemperature at the normal point. Even other more technical reasons\ncould be given to demonstrate the error of the superstition regarding\nthe seventh-month child--a conviction endorsed by medical men\nhundreds of years ago and as yet not discarded by the laity.\n\nWhen pregnancy has reached \"term,\" the child, having completed its\nprenatal development, is ready to cope with conditions as they exist\nin the external world. At term the average child is twenty inches\nlong and weighs 7 1/7 pounds (3,250 grams). The length is remarkably\nconstant; but the weight, as is well known, is often somewhat above\nor below the average figure. In a general way, smaller children occur\nin the first than in subsequent pregnancies, and, moreover, may be\nexpected when the mother is a small woman, or poorly nourished, or\nhas worked hard during her pregnancy. On the other hand, a tendency\nto bear large children is present when the opposite conditions\nprevail. It is not unusual to see infants weighing eight or nine\npounds at birth, but babies of more than ten pounds are rare, and the\nfabulous, though not infrequent, reports of fifteen and twenty-pound\ninfants are probably not based upon actual weighings, but upon the\nimpression of someone who has merely seen the child or perhaps\nguessed the weight from lifting it.\n\nAlthough the fetus frequently changes its position during the earlier\nmonths of pregnancy, generally by the beginning of the tenth lunar\nmonth it has assumed a permanent posture. It has then reached such a\nsize that it can best be accommodated in the cavity of the uterus if\nits various parts are folded together so as to give the fetus an\novoid shape. To secure this form its back is arched forward, and its\nhead bent so that its chin touches its chest; its arms are crossed\njust below the head, its legs raised in front of the abdomen, and its\nknees doubled up. In this form the fetus occupies the smallest\npossible space.\n\nWith relation to the mother the position of the child, for several\nweeks before birth, is one in which its long axis is parallel to the\nlong axis of her body. This remains true no matter whether the head\nor the buttocks are to precede at the time of birth. In ninety-seven\nout of a hundred cases, however, the head lies lowermost and\nconsequently is the first portion of the child to be born. The\nopposite position, in which the head is the last portion born, is,\neven with the most skillful treatment, somewhat more serious for the\ninfant, though not for the mother.\n\nTHE NEWBORN INFANT.--The baby at birth is not a miniature man. As\ncompared with an adult its head and abdomen are relatively large, its\nchest relatively small; its limbs are short in proportion to the\nbody; and at first glance it appears to have no neck at all. The\nmiddle point of a baby's length is situated about the level of the\nnavel, whereas in a man the legs alone represent approximately half\nhis height. The changes after birth consist chiefly in growth; but\nnot altogether, since at least one organ, the thymus gland, becomes\nsmaller and completely disappears during childhood, and other organs,\nespecially the liver, are proportionately smaller in the adult than\nin the infant.\n\nThe body of the infant also differs from that of the man in\npossessing greater softness and flexibility. These qualities depend\nupon the nature of its skeleton, which is composed of more bones than\nlater in life, when several have fused together to form one to give\nthe mature body a more rigid frame. Furthermore, the individual bones\nare not so firm, consisting of an elastic material called cartilage,\nso that some movements which in an adult would cause such serious\ninjuries as fractures and dislocations are perfectly harmless to a\nnewborn child.\n\nThe legs are not only short in proportion to the body but are always\ncurved, and the feet are held with the soles directed toward one\nanother, a position clearly abnormal in the adult. But every mother\nshould know that these are natural conditions in the infant, and are\nthe result of the posture of the child before birth. They soon\nstraighten out. The bowed legs of an adult are of an entirely\ndifferent origin, resulting from a disturbance of nutrition in\ninfancy called rickets.\n\nA small amount of short wooly hair is usually found over the back of\na newborn infant. More conspicuous, however, is the presence there of\na gray, fatty substance which, though always more abundant over the\nback, is at times distributed over the whole body; rarely is it\nentirely absent. The material, technically named the vernix, is the\nproduct of the glands in the skin and is a perfectly normal\nsecretion. After its removal, which is readily accomplished by\ngreasing the infant with lard or vaselin before giving the initial\nbath, it never reappears.\n\nA varying amount of hair covers the head of the infant. No\nsignificance should be attached to the quantity, for the conviction\nthat exists, especially among negroes, that a heavy suit of hair for\nthe child occasions \"heart-burn\" in the mother during pregnancy is\nwithout foundation. The color of the hair at birth does not indicate\nits ultimate shade; changes are often noted during infancy. Similarly\nthe permanent color of the eyes is not assumed until later; at the\ntime of birth the eyes are generally, if not always, blue in color.\n\nA baby's head is a matter of great concern to the family.\nOccasionally, the skull is round and well shaped from the moment of\nbirth, but more often it is long and narrow; sometimes the form is\neven startling to the inexperienced. The peculiar shape of the head\nresults, of course, from its passage through the birth-canal and is\nnot a sign of any disease. In a few weeks, or even less, the strange\nappearance passes away. It is unwise to attempt to alter the shape of\nthe head by bandaging or massaging since the growth of the brain will\nspontaneously accomplish what is desired; interference can do no\ngood, and may do serious harm.\n\nNature facilitates an appropriate molding of the head during birth so\nas to permit its easy passage through the bony pelvic cavity of the\nmother, and gains that end in two ways. The bones of the head remain\npliable until after the infant is born, and, further, their edges are\nnot welded together as in an adult, but are separated from one\nanother by an appreciable distance. During the act of birth the edges\nare brought into contact or even overlap, materially reducing the\nsize of the head. Within a few hours after birth the bones again\nspread apart, and some months elapse before they begin to unite; the\nunion is not completed until some time during the second year of\ninfancy.\n\nMany mothers are anxious to know how far the senses of the infant\nhave developed when it enters the world. This problem has stimulated\nsome scientific investigation, though hardly so much as its interest\nwould justify. Two lines of inquiry have been pursued toward its\nsolution. The objective point of one of these has been to determine\nhow nearly the sense organs of the newborn correspond anatomically to\nthose of an adult; that is how perfectly has their organization been\ncompleted. The other has been to learn how the infant reacts when the\nvarious senses are stimulated; the interpretation of these reactions\nis, however, particularly liable to error and sometimes amounts only\nto guesswork.\n\nThe organization of the nerves and muscles in the eye is far from\nperfect at the time of birth. The muscles act irregularly; indeed,\nthe lack of muscular adjustment is such that movements of the eye\nlikely to alarm the parents are regularly observed in very young\ninfants. Furthermore they cannot focus images which fall upon their\neyes. The retina, which receives visual impressions, has reached such\ndevelopment at birth, however, that sensations of light can be\nperceived. For example, if a lamp is suddenly flashed before the face\nof a newly born baby it cries. From this and similar evidence,\nindicating that strong light irritates the delicate structures of the\neye, we have learned that a nursery should not be illuminated, during\nthe day or night, so brightly as the rooms adults occupy. Certainly\nseveral weeks, and probably several months, pass before an infant can\nsee anything save as blurs of light and darkness. Objects, such as a\nhand, probably appear as shadows, which are not correctly interpreted\nuntil late in infancy.\n\nIn regard to color vision we have as yet no reliable information\nconcerning children under two years of age. Infants of less than a\nyear have been known to distinguish certain colored papers. But such\ndiscrimination is probably due to a difference in brightness of the\ncolors.\n\nAlthough the organ of hearing is well developed at birth, the drum of\nthe ear in very young infants cannot transmit sounds, as in the\nadult. For the latter kind of transmission it is necessary that the\npressure on both sides of the drum-membrane should be equal, and this\nis arranged by the admission of air to the middle ear through a\npassage from the throat. At the time of birth, on account of the\nswollen condition of the mucous membrane which lines this passage, it\nis blocked, and the middle ear is filled with fluid; these conditions\ninterfere with the transmission of sound, and consequently its\nperception is dulled. But even in the absence of a drum-membrane an\nadult can hear; the vibrations in such cases are transmitted through\nthe bones of the skull, and this very likely also occurs in newly\nborn infants. In most instances, at least, they react to a\ndisagreeable noise within the first twenty-four hours, and their\nsensitiveness in this direction explains why the nursery should be\nkept quiet.\n\nInvestigators have not come to uniform conclusions concerning the\nsense of smell and of taste. In all likelihood, smell is not acute at\nthe time of birth. Taste probably is better perceived, yet some\nnewborn babies are said to suck a two per cent solution of quinin as\neagerly as milk, though stronger solutions are distasteful. According\nto the best available information a young infant can detect the\ndifference between a sweet, bitter, sour, or salty taste only when\nthe tests are made with a solution possessing the quality in question\nto a marked degree. It is common knowledge that babies cheerfully\nsuck the most tasteless objects, and it is not improbable that at\nfirst the reaction depends upon the temperature of the object and the\nfeeling it creates in the mouth.\n\nThe moment it is born, a baby perceives pressure if its skin is\ntouched. To this sensation, however, some parts of the body are much\nmore sensitive than others; the tongue and lips are most sensitive of\nall. Heat and cold are probably perceived more acutely by infants\nthan by adults; to pain, on the other hand, babies are less\nsensitive. An infant is aware of the movements of its own muscles,\nand also appreciates a change from one position to another, as\nexperienced nurses know very well, and on that account carefully\navoid keeping a baby on one side continuously.\n\nThe vast majority of movements performed by young infants are reflex\nacts, that is, the cerebrum, the part of the brain with which\nthinking is done, is not concerned with their performance. Of these\nreflexes the most notable are sucking and swallowing, but sneezing,\ncoughing, choking, and hiccoughing may also be observed; stretching\nand yawning have been recorded in several instances, even during the\nfirst days of infant life. None of these movements, we must remember,\nare produced consciously; the baby cannot reason and does not\nrecognize anyone, even its mother.\n\nHEREDITY.--The transmission of bodily resemblance and of traits of\ncharacter from parent to child is a broad and complicated subject,\nwhose fundamental principles biologists are just beginning to grasp.\nThe facts thus far established regarding heredity relate chiefly to\nplants and to the lower animals. There is no doubt whatever that the\nmeager knowledge we possess of heredity in man will be amplified and\nwill ultimately indicate on the one hand the marriages which are\nadvisable and, on the other hand, those which are not. Indeed, the\nfoundations for a science called Eugenics, which purposes to improve\nthe human race in this way, have already been laid. It is barely a\ndecade, however, since our knowledge of heredity has approached that\norder and system which entitle it to be ranked as a science; and in\nthis brief period great strides could hardly be expected in its most\nintricate field, that of human inheritance.\n\nThe modern teachings of heredity are of interest to us, nevertheless,\nsince they intimate the time when a child's inheritance is fixed and\nthe means by which hereditary characters are conveyed. To understand\nthese fundamental points we must recall that at the moment of\nconception a male germinal cell combines with a female cell, and that\nthis act, which is named fertilization, brings together vital\nelements from the two parents. We have seen that the spermatozoon\nrepresents the solitary contribution of the father toward the\ndevelopment of the child, and the spermatozoon, therefore, must\nconvey the material basis of paternal inheritance. Similarly we might\nexpect the ovum to be the bearer of the maternal qualities inherited\nby the child. This is actually true; but much of the evidence is of a\ntechnical character and must be omitted. Yet an experiment\nsuccessfully conducted by Castle and Phillips will indicate, even to\nthose who have no special knowledge of the mechanism of heredity, the\nimportant role the ovum plays. These investigators removed the\novaries from an albino guinea-pig, and in their place substituted the\novaries of a black guinea-pig. \"From numerous experiments it may be\nemphatically stated that normal albinos mated together produce only\nalbinos.\" But in this experiment the result was otherwise, for the\nalbino into which the ovaries of a black guinea-pig were grafted\nproduced only black offspring. The color-coat of her young,\ntherefore, was not influenced by her own white hair, but was\ndetermined by the eggs really belonging to the black animal from\nwhich the ovaries were taken; in no other way can the result be\ninterpreted. It is certain, moreover, that the mode of transmission\nof material qualities here exemplified is not exceptional; on the\ncontrary there is no doubt that the ovum always conveys the sum total\nof the qualities the offspring inherits from the mother.\n\nThe germinal cells then contain the material basis of inheritance,\nand in all probability the substance is located within the nucleus of\nthe cells. This substance had been seen and studied long before its\nrelation to the problem of heredity was suspected. Because it takes a\ndeeper stain than the rest of the nucleus, it stands out prominently\nwhen the cell is treated with certain dyes, and this property\naccounts for its name--chromatin. Under such conditions as prevail\njust before a cell divides, the chromatic substance is broken up and\nreassembled in the form of rods called chromosomes. Curiously enough\nthe number of rods is uniform for each species of animal, though\ndifferent numbers are characteristic of different species; the\ncharacteristic number for man is twenty-four.\n\nUnless some arrangement was made to prevent it, the act of\nfertilization would cause the number of chromosomes in the fertilized\novum to be double the number characteristic of the species. In man,\nfor example, the addition of twenty-four chromosomes from the\nspermatozoon to an ovum that already contained twenty-four\nchromosomes of its own would mean that after fertilization the ovum\ncontained forty-eight. Such a result is prevented through the process\nto which we have referred in the preceding chapter as the ripening of\nthe ovum, and also through a similar process in the case of the\nspermatozoon. These two processes lead to a reduction in the number\nof chromosomes, so that finally every human germinal cell contains\ntwelve, and therefore when the ovum is fertilized the characteristic\nnumber twenty-four is restored. While we know nothing of the forces\nwhich determine, on the one hand, what elements shall be discarded by\nthe germinal cells and, on the other hand, what elements shall\nremain, it is definitely proved that a selective process always takes\nplace. This fact admirably explains the variation in the\ncharacteristics inherited by children of the same family. So far as\nis known, the traits which will be passed on from either parent are a\nmatter of chance. Whatever these hereditary traits happen to be, the\nbest evidence we have indicates that the problem of a child's\ninheritance is settled once for all the moment conception takes\nplace.\n\nMATERNAL IMPRESSIONS.--Contrary to all that we know of heredity, the\nconviction prevails among the laity that the character of a child\ndepends greatly upon the mother's surroundings during pregnancy: this\nis the doctrine of maternal impressions. As is usual with\nsuperstitions, this one emphasizes the unfavorable possibilities and\nholds that the unborn child may be affected by the mother's unhappy\nthoughts or maimed by her mental distress if she is exposed to\nunpleasant sights. For this belief there is no foundation; the cases\noften cited in its support may be fully explained on the grounds of\ncoincidence.\n\nWith the possible exception of such individuals as are spending their\nlives in solitary confinement, there is scarcely a human being who\nhas not in the course of nine consecutive months some untoward\nphysical or mental experience which engraves itself upon the memory.\nProspective mothers are not apt to be exempt from a rule so general\nin its application, but if by good chance one happens so to be she\nwill hardly fail to hear of the misfortune of others, which,\naccording to the doctrine of maternal impressions, may be equally\neffective in interfering with the proper development of the child. We\nshould then rightly expect most, if not all, babies to be \"marked\"--\nclearly a situation which does not prevail.\n\nIn order to learn how frequently prospective mothers may have\ndisagreeable experiences which they fear will affect the formation of\nthe child, I have lately asked the patients whom I have attended,\n\"Was there any incident during your pregnancy to which you could have\nattributed the infant's condition, had it been marked?\" The babies of\nall those to whom the question was submitted were normal; yet without\nexception those whose pregnancies just completed were their first\nanswered in the affirmative. It is also pertinent that one of these\npatients had lost her brother by a violent and accidental death when\nshe was four months pregnant; a similar bereavement was suffered by\nanother at the eighth month; each was, however, delivered of a\nperfectly healthy child. Among those with whom the recently ended\npregnancy was not the first I found some who could remember incidents\npopularly believed to have an influence over the development of the\nembryo; most of them, however, had given the matter so little thought\nthat they could not definitely recall whether such incidents had\noccurred or not. From a similar series of observations covering two\nthousand cases, William Hunter came to the conclusion, nearly two\nhundred years ago, that there was no support for the belief in\nmaternal impressions.\n\nWhenever a child does happen to develop abnormally, it must be clear\nthat, from the very nature of our existence, some incident can be\nrecalled which will satisfactorily, yet unjustly, bear the blame. It\nmay be confidently said, however, that, for every mother whose fears\nare realized, hundreds are agreeably disappointed in finding their\nbabies perfectly normal. In the face of so many negative instances it\nis amazing that any person, even though ignorant of medical teaching,\nshould be inclined to attribute abnormal development to something the\nmother has seen or heard, thought or dreamt, or otherwise experienced\nwhile she was pregnant. Yet unfortunately many do believe this. It is\nworth while, therefore, to supply further evidence, and thus escape\nany suspicion of unfairness in argument, to prove that maternal\nimpressions are unable to affect the formation of the embryo.\n\nIt is found, as a matter of experience, that the superstition\nregarding maternal impressions generally begins to cause anxiety\nduring the second half of pregnancy; and then such an influence is\nentirely out of the question. By the end of the second month the form\nof the embryo has been definitely determined, and subsequently cannot\nbe altered. It is even true that errors in development are most apt\nto occur within the two or three weeks that immediately follow\nconception, and therefore occur at a time when pregnancy is not often\nclearly recognized. Thus it happens that women begin to worry about\nthe influence their minds will have upon the formation of the child\nlong after its form has been established.\n\nIncidents in the life of a prospective mother are in point of fact\nequally inert so far as their influence upon development is\nconcerned, no matter whether they occur during the earlier or later\npart of pregnancy. There is never any anatomical means by which\nmaternal impressions could be conveyed to the embryo. Such an\ninfluence would have to be exerted through the placenta; and that is\nimpossible. There are no nerves in the placenta to carry impulses\nfrom the mother to the child. Even the blood streams of the two\nbeings are kept apart; and though it is unheard of that the blood\nshould carry nerve impulses, if that happened to be the case, it\ncould not prove effective here, for the blood of the mother does not\nenter the child. It is nourished by food which passes from the\nmother's blood, to be sure, but there is no more reason to expect\nthis nutriment to exert an hereditary influence than there is to\nexpect an infant to grow to resemble the cow with the milk of which\nit is fed. With these two possibilities eliminated, no path can be\nimagined by which impulses might travel from the mother to the\nembryo.\n\nScientific investigation has brought to light these facts, as it has\nalso taught the real causation of the disfigurement once attributed\nto the mother's mind. Departures from the usual form of the body\noccur during the earliest days of pregnancy and arise in consequence\nof some irregularity in the process which molds the body-form from a\nsimple spherical mass of cells. Why irregularities sometimes occur is\nnot altogether clear; except in so far as it has been determined that\nthe fault lies within the embryo itself. Whenever these defects are\nassociated with events which have disturbed the mother's mind, it\ncannot be other than a simple coincidence.",

        "content": "THE FOOD REQUIREMENTS DURING PREGNANCY\n\nThe Food-stuffs: Water; Mineral Material; Protein; Carbohydrate; Fat--\nWhat We Do to Our Food--How Much Food Is Needed During Pregnancy?--\nThe Importance of Liquid Nourishment--The Choice of Food--Cravings--\nThe Relation Between the Mother's Diet and the Size of the Child.\n\nThere is a gain in weight during pregnancy amounting finally to about\nthirty pounds; exceptionally, it is as little as ten or fifteen\npounds, and, at the other extreme, as much as forty or fifty. With\nindividuals inclined to be stout the increase is greater, and it is\nrelatively greater in later pregnancies than in the first. During the\nearly months of pregnancy the weight generally remains stationary or\nsuffers a slight loss; even in those rare instances in which the\nweight begins to increase shortly after conception the gain is less\nmarked in the earlier months than later. For the last three months\nthe average monthly gain has been found to be between three and a\nhalf and five and a half pounds.\n\nThe weight gained during pregnancy is not, as can be readily\nunderstood, permanently retained. At the time of birth, in\nconsequence of the expulsion of the child, the after-birth, the\namniotic fluid, and a varying amount of blood, there is necessarily a\nloss of from ten to fifteen pounds. Later, as the maternal tissues,\nwhose growth has been stimulated during pregnancy, return to their\noriginal condition, a further loss in weight takes place. It is not\nunusual, however, for women to remain permanently better nourished\nthan before they became pregnant. Under ordinary conditions the food\nof the prospective mother provides not only for her own wants but\nalso for those of the embryo. Between the two organisms there exists\na relation which resembles that existing between a house in course of\nconstruction and the contractor who supplies the building material.\nThe mother furnishes what is needed to construct the \"living\nedifice,\" as Huxley called the growing embryo, but she is not\nresponsible for the lines of the building. The embryo is both\narchitect and mechanic, designing the structure and arranging the\n\"organic bricks\" in their proper places. The work of construction\nnecessitates the expenditure of an appreciable amount of energy and\nthe creation of waste products that must be removed, lest they\naccumulate and interfere with the growing structure. These waste\nproducts leave the embryo by way of the umbilical cord and the\nplacenta and return thus into the mother's circulation; ultimately\nthey leave the mother through the same channels that carry off her\nown waste. First and last, then, the nutrition of the mother and of\nthe child are so bound together that it has been impossible to study\nthem separately. Our knowledge of food requirements during pregnancy\nhas been obtained by measuring the food requirements of the mother\nalone; and as nutrition during gestation is fundamentally the same as\nnutrition at other times, it is necessary for us first to consider in\ngeneral the food needed by the human body.\n\nTHE FOOD-STUFFS.--The waste products we throw off indicate that the\nsubstances which compose our bodies are being constantly broken down\nand reduced to a condition such that they are useless to us. In\nnormal persons hunger signifies that they need material to replace\nwhat has been used up. The substances thus required, if the wants of\nthe body are to be satisfied correctly, are called the food-stuffs;\nand they are the same during pregnancy as at other times. The\nfoodstuffs are usually classified according to their chemical\nproperties; on this basis they are placed in five groups: (1) Water,\n(2) Mineral Materials, (3) Proteins, (4) Carbohydrates, (5) Fats.\n\nIn view of the different purposes which the foodstuffs serve, it is\nconvenient to group them in another way. Thus, the carbohydrates and\nthe fats may be placed together because they are the body fuel; their\nvalue consists in the heat and energy which they yield when acted\nupon in the tissues. Water and mineral matter, on the other hand, are\nnever a source of energy; they assist in building new tissue or in\nrepairing tissue that already exists. The proteins are unique, in\nthat they may serve either purpose. Primarily the proteins are\ntissue-builders, but in the absence of sufficient fat or carbohydrate\nthe body burns protein to secure heat and energy.\n\nEach food-stuff, therefore, serves a distinct purpose, and some of\nthem render services which the others cannot perform. A man will die\nif either water or mineral matter or protein is completely withdrawn\nfrom his diet. Fat or carbohydrate, on the other hand, or even both\nof them, may be excluded for some time without causing serious\ninconvenience. It is true, nevertheless, that each food-stuff\nperforms some task better than any of the others can perform it, and\nfor that reason all of them should be included in the diet of an\nhealthy individual.\n\nSome of the food-stuffs, such as water and table salt, come to the\nbody separate from the others; but generally the different types\nreach us intimately mingled in the various articles of food in common\nuse. Foods vary greatly, however, in the amount of the different\nfood-stuffs they contain. The meats, for example, have a relatively\nlarge protein content; in the vegetables starch, which is one of the\ncarbohydrates, predominates. As to the choice of food and the amount\nthat is necessary for the average person, generally the appetite is a\nsafe guide; but the accurate observations of physiologists have gone\nso far as to determine the exact requirements of the body. Not the\nleast important principle taught by these investigations is to avoid\ndietary fads, for in arranging a satisfactory diet the problem to be\nsolved is not, What is it possible to live on? but, What serves best\nas nourishment? The experience of countless generations has taught us\nthat we thrive best on a diet which includes all five food-stuffs.\n\n_Water_ constitutes nearly two-thirds of the weight of the body.\nAs water is constantly being given up in the life process, health\ndemands an abundant supply of liquids to replace the waste. The\naverage daily loss has been found to be between two and three quarts.\nOf this amount the urine constitutes nearly two-thirds; and the\nremaining third is eliminated through the skin, the lungs, and the\nbowels. Although the deficiency thus created is met in part by the\nwater in our solid food, the greater part of the loss is made up by\nthe liquids we drink, and we are warned, in a measure, by the\nsensation of thirst that they are needed.\n\n_Mineral material_ is of the greatest importance as a\nconstituent of our food. It contributes to the welfare of the body in\nat least three ways; (1) it gives rigidity to the bones, (2) it\nsupplies an essential ingredient of the living substance in all the\ntissues, (3) it is present in the blood and in the other body fluids,\nwhere it is of service in such vital processes as the beating of the\nheart, the transportation of oxygen to every portion of the body, and\nthe maintenance of an acid or alkaline condition of the digestive\njuices according as the one or the other is necessary for the\nassimilation of the food.\n\nAn animal deprived of mineral food will die as surely as one deprived\nof water. In arranging our diets, however, we are not compelled to\ntake the minerals into account, for, with the exception of table salt\n(sodium chlorid), the meat and vegetables that we eat provide the\nmineral material the body requires. Iron, for example, which imparts\nto the blood one of its most essential qualities, occurs in\nrelatively large amounts in apples, spinach, lettuce, potatoes, peas,\ncarrots, and meats. Only now and then does it become advisable to add\niron deliberately to the diet. Similarly lime (calcium) the material\nthat makes the bones hard, is present in quantities ample for the\nneeds of the body in the bread, milk, eggs and vegetables that we\neat. The remaining mineral constituents of the body, among which the\nmost conspicuous are magnesium, potassium, sulphur, and phosphorus,\noccur in foods which we are naturally inclined to take, so that we\nsecure an abundance of them unconsciously.\n\n_Protein_, the third food-stuff which we must eat to keep alive,\ncontains the chemical element nitrogen in such form that it can be\nincorporated in our tissues. Although most persons derive their\nprotein in part from meat, milk, and eggs, it is possible to satisfy\nthe requirements of the body on a purely vegetarian diet. Experience\nhas shown, however, that it is both natural and advantageous that we\nemploy a mixed diet.\n\nThe property of protein to build living tissue and replace tissue\nwaste probably depends upon several factors; but certainly one of\nthem is the presence of nitrogen. So intimately associated are the\nconsumption of the tissue substance and the elimination of nitrogen\nthat we have no better way of judging the amount of tissue substance\nused in the body than by determining the quantity of nitrogen that\nappears in its various waste products. From such investigations it\nhas been found that the quantity of protein required to repair the\nbreaking down of the tissues is not great. The average man consumes\napproximately a quarter of a pound (100 to 120 grams) of protein\ndaily; but this quantity is in excess of his real needs. Indeed,\nChittenden has shown that for various classes of individuals, namely,\nstudents, athletes and soldiers, half as much is sufficient. Other\nphysiologists, though admitting that this is true, contend that it is\ninadvisable to regulate one's diet on such a slender basis. Very good\nreasons are assigned for the view that more protein is needed than\njust enough to counterbalance the tissue waste. Thus, in the case of\nanimals, it has been found that a diet low in protein finally causes\ndigestive disturbances and other ailments.\n\nAlthough it does not seem advisable to practise rigid economy in\narranging the protein content of the diet, it is equally important\nthat we should not go to the other extreme. The consumption of over-\nlarge quantities of protein, as would be the case if we lived\nexclusively upon meat, increases putrefaction in the intestines and\nthrows unnecessary work upon the kidneys, which are the organs\nchiefly concerned in getting rid of the waste products of protein.\n\n_Carbohydrate_ is the name given the group of foodstuffs to\nwhich the sugars belong. The food value of cane sugar, the most\nfamiliar member of the group, was recognized even in prehistoric days\nby the natives of India. By boiling the plant we call sugar-cane they\nobtained a substance to which they gave the name Sakkara, and from\nthis our word sugar evidently originated. The roots of this plant\nwere carried into Europe and cultivated during the Middle Ages.\nObviously, its value was and is appreciated, since the cultivation of\nthe sugar-cane and the sugar-beet has become the foundation of a\ngreat modern industry.\n\nThere are some persons, perhaps, who do not realize that beside cane\nsugar many kinds of carbohydrate occur in our food. Glucose or grape\nsugar, for example, occurs not only in the fruit indicated by its\nname, but also in other fruits, in corn, in onions, and in the common\nvegetables. Glucose is especially suited to act as nourishing food.\nIn keeping with that fact our digestive juices convert most of the\nsugars we eat, if not all of them, into glucose, which is regularly\npresent in our blood. It is unnecessary to enumerate all or even the\nmore important compounds included in the carbohydrate group; but\neveryone should know that starch is its chief member, and that after\nbeing thoroughly digested starch enters the body as glucose and\ntherefore serves the same purpose as sugar.\n\nThe value of carbohydrates as a source of heat and energy may be\naccurately measured, and is technically expressed in terms of a unit,\ncalled the calorie. As the energy which our bodies require may be\nestimated in the same terms, it is possible to determine whether or\nnot our food is equal to our wants. Very naturally the energy\nrequirements of any individual are influenced by his weight and by\nthe work he does. But we may take as a standard the results of an\nextensive study of American families which indicate that women\nrequire four-fifths as much energy-yielding food as men. It also\nseems safe to conclude that a woman weighing 130 pounds who does her\nown housework requires food every day having an energy-value of 2,500\ncalories; smaller women and those who do no work require somewhat\nless. In a mixed diet the chief source of this energy--and the source\nfrom which it is most economically obtained--is the carbohydrates.\n\n_Fat_ yields more energy and heat than does carbohydrate, bulk\nfor bulk; but fat is burned by our tissues less readily. We\ninstinctively avoid eating a great deal of this food-stuff; in the\ncourse of a day the average person consumes no more than one or two\nounces. The natural aversion which many feel toward fat may possibly\ndepend upon the difficulty with which they assimilate it. In colder\nclimates, however, we know fat to be a staple article of diet; and it\nis not unlikely that the very conditions which make it necessary\nthere explain the unusual tolerance for it.\n\nFat is more than fuel. Deposited in our bodies, beneath the skin for\nexample, it prevents the escape of heat that we generate and protects\nus against the penetration of cold. This food-stuff, therefore,\ncontributes in several ways toward maintaining the temperature of the\nbody at a constant level.\n\nOur source of fat is chiefly animal food and in a smaller measure\nvegetables; but the fat our food contains is not altogether\nresponsible for the fat in our bodies. Carbohydrates, if in excess of\nmomentary needs, are partly converted into fat and stored as such. A\nreserve supply of nourishment is thus provided, and is drawn upon\nonly when the food that we consume does not contain as much energy as\nwe expend.\n\nWHAT WE DO TO OUR FOOD.--With the exception of water and mineral\nsubstances, the food-stuffs must undergo chemical alterations before\nthey are capable of being absorbed into the body; this is the work of\ndigestion. The digestive processes, the main purpose of which is to\nbreak up the carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into substances of\nmuch simpler chemical structure, begin in the mouth and are not\ncompleted until some time after the food has entered the intestine.\nAs the food moves through the alimentary canal, it is mixed with the\nvarious digestive juices containing ferments, such as pepsin, which\nare the active agents of digestion. Although digestive processes go\non automatically, they are, in a degree that is far from negligible,\ninfluenced by the mind. Thus, cheerfulness promotes digestion, and\nnot infrequently mental depression may be the direct cause of\nindigestion. Indeed, it is chiefly in regard to the state of the mind\nof the prospective mother that the existence of pregnancy may be said\nto have a bearing, whether favorable or unfavorable, upon her\ndigestion.\n\nThe digestive juices are prepared in glands which lie either within\nthe lining of the alimentary canal or adjacent to it. In the latter\nevent the glands are connected with the canal by means of tubes.\nThese glands must be warned when to pour out their secretion, and\ntheir very first warning usually comes from the agreeable sensations\nexperienced when we see, smell, or taste inviting food. If we are\nhungry, our viands attractive, and our surroundings congenial, the\nstimulus excites a plentiful secretion of the digestive juices;\nconversely, the opposite conditions, to some extent, check their\nflow.\n\nThe sight of attractive food, as we all know, \"makes the mouth\nwater,\" that is, it calls forth the saliva which contains one of the\ndigestive ferments. Thus, at the beginning of a meal, favorable\nconditions for digestion are established. The saliva, however, acts\nonly upon starch; and, moreover, its action upon this carbohydrate is\nweak unless the food is thoroughly chewed and mixed in the mouth.\nMost of us, perhaps, overlook the importance of mastication, which\nnot only crushes all the food-stuffs, preparing them for efficient\ndigestion, but also stimulates the flow of the digestive juices.\nFurthermore, by thoroughly masticating our food, we know intuitively\nwhen we have had enough, and thus avoid overeating.\n\nIn the stomach the digestion of starch is continued for a time, but\nthe chief work of gastric digestion concerns the proteins. They alone\nare attacked by pepsin, a ferment secreted by the mucous membrane of\nthe stomach. Moreover, since pepsin is able to act only when an acid\nis present, the gastric mucous membrane also secretes hydrochloric\nacid.\n\nJust as the digestive glands in the neighborhood of the mouth become\nmore active when we are conscious that desirable food is at hand, so\ndo the glands in the stomach. Mastication also stimulates the flow of\nthe gastric juice, and this flow is greater if we enjoy what we eat.\nFurthermore, it has been shown that, after entrance into the stomach,\nthe food itself increases the flow of the digestive juices. All\narticles of food are not, however, equally efficient in producing\nthis effect: thus meat requires more pepsin for satisfactory\ndigestion than bread, and consequently meat calls forth a larger\nquantity of gastric juice.\n\nFat in all probability is not digested in the stomach; even starch\nand protein are not broken down sufficiently by the time gastric\ndigestion is complete to permit them to be absorbed into the body.\n\"The value of digestion in the stomach,\" as Howell says, \"is not so\nmuch in its own action as in its combined action with that which\ntakes place in the intestine.\" It is even possible for satisfactory\ndigestion to take place without the assistance of the stomach. This\nfact has been substantiated by several cases in which men have lived\nfor years after the stomach was removed to eradicate a disease. It is\ntrue, nevertheless, that intestinal digestion can be performed more\neconomically if it begins where gastric digestion normally leaves\noff.\n\nOf the changes wrought in the food by the various digestive\nprocesses, those which are the most profound take place in the\nintestine. While the food is being moved through this organ--some\nthirty feet in length--it is reduced to simple chemical fragments,\nwhich are absorbed by the intestinal wall. Digestion in the intestine\nis carried on through the agency of a number of ferments, the more\nimportant of which are supplied in the juice manufactured by the\npancreas. The pancreatic secretion contains three separate and\ndistinct ferments, which act respectively upon carbohydrate, protein,\nand fat. The absorption of fat, however, is materially assisted also\nby the action of the bile.\n\nA part of what we eat always escapes digestion; the unused portion,\nit has been estimated, is somewhat less than one-tenth of an ordinary\nmixed diet. The residue from vegetables is notably larger than the\nresidue from meat. The _undigested_ portions of all the food-\nstuffs collect in the lowermost portion of the intestine and form a\npart of the feces. Here also are gathered the _indigestible_\nmaterial we have eaten, the products of bacterial decomposition in\nthe intestine, and other waste substances that the body should throw\noff.\n\nHOW MUCH FOOD IS NEEDED DURING PREGNANCY?--In connection with the\ndevelopment of the child we have already referred to the difference\nin the purpose of the constructive processes which go on in the\nearlier months of gestation and those which take place in the later\nmonths. In a general way the first half of pregnancy is occupied with\nthe formation of the embryo from relatively simple structural\nelements, the second half with its growth into an infant, which\nacquires ninety per cent. of its substance and weight at birth after\nthe fifth month of embryonic development. A similar contrast may be\nobserved in the nutritional processes of the mother. Often, at the\nbeginning of pregnancy, the appetite is poor and there is\nindisposition of one kind or another, with the natural result that\nthere is slight if any change in the mother's weight; whereas later a\nperiod ensues when her appetite increases, her health improves, and\nshe gains in weight.\n\nSince it is natural that the weight of the mother should remain\npractically stationary during the early months of pregnancy, it is\nclear that a diet which has previously been ample will likewise be\nsufficient for some time after conception has taken place. To most\npersons, however, it is not clear that the quantity of food\nordinarily eaten will suffice also during the later months of\npregnancy. On the contrary, popular opinion holds that the\nprospective mother \"should eat for two.\" It is not unimportant to\npoint out the erroneous character of this superstition, because\novereating during pregnancy is much more likely to provoke discomfort\nthan insufficient nourishment.\n\nIn order to comprehend the nutritional needs of the prospective\nmother, one must keep in mind the fact that our food always serves\ntwo purposes. These are, as we have seen, to build or to repair\ntissue and to furnish heat and energy. Since these needs of the body\nduring pregnancy--as at all other times--are best understood when\nconsidered in their relation to the food-stuffs which supply them, we\nshall take up these various ingredients separately.\n\nProtein, which repairs tissue and also furnishes the substance from\nwhich new tissue is made, is used more economically during pregnancy\nthan when the maternal functions are inactive. As a result of this\neconomy the same allowance of protein which is sufficient before\nconception is sufficient also during pregnancy. This fact has been\nput in the clearest light by extensive observations made upon\nanimals. Dogs which were not pregnant, for example, have been\ncarefully fed so that their food should contain just enough protein\nto cover the needs of the body and keep their weight constant.\nSubsequently, when these animals became pregnant precisely the same\namount of protein was fed to them. The result was that they gained in\nweight, and at the same time the waste products of protein they threw\noff were notably diminished. Such observations, of which there have\nbeen a large number yielding concordant results, may be safely taken\nto mean that an amount of protein previously satisfactory for the\nanimal is also sufficient for her during pregnancy. We are forced to\nconclude that protein was used more sparingly in the latter\ncondition--a view which has been repeatedly confirmed with regard to\nhuman beings as well as animals. It is found, for example, that an\namount of protein competent to meet the needs of a man of a given\nweight will not only provide for the wants of a woman of equal weight\nwhile she is pregnant, but will also leave a surplus sufficient for\nthe growth of the fetus.\n\nWith regard to the mineral substances, likewise investigations\nindicate that the \"housekeeping\" of the body during pregnancy\nproceeds along unusually economic lines. It is not advisable,\ntherefore, to make any change in the diet with regard to these\nsubstances. Attempts have been made to cut down the amount of\nminerals in the food for the purpose of softening the fetal skeleton.\nThe success sometimes attributed to these efforts is, however, very\ndoubtful, for we know that the mother's tissues will be robbed of\nminerals for the embryo whenever her food fails to contain them in\nsufficient amount for her own needs and those of the child.\nPractically speaking, the mineral content of diet during pregnancy\nrequires no thought, for so long as meat and vegetables are eaten in\nsatisfactory quantity the mineral nutrition will take care of itself.\n\nThe food-stuffs which supply heat and energy, since the amount of\nenergy utilized by the body during the latter months of pregnancy is\nsomewhat in excess of that previously required, do not follow the\nsame rule as the protein and the mineral matter. It has been found\nthat just before the fetus becomes mature the energy requirements of\nthe mother are approximately one-fifth greater than in the non-\npregnant condition. It is certain, however, that no extra demand for\nenergy exists until the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy, and that\nthe excessive requirement is extremely small until the last three or\nfour weeks. Even then the prospective mother requires less energy-\ngiving food than the average man.\n\nSince the body handles carbohydrate more readily than fat, it is\npreferable that whatever additional energy pregnancy necessitates\nshould be supplied by carbohydrates. An increase in the daily\nconsumption of fatty food, over and above that previously found\nagreeable, is not only unnecessary but undesirable. Every-day\nexperience teaches that less fat taken with the meals promotes the\ncomfort of the prospective mother. A glass of rich milk a little\nbefore meal time, however, not only makes up for this omission but\nalso prevents \"heart-burn,\" a very common ailment of pregnancy.\n\nAlthough there is an appreciable increase in the quantity of starch\nand sugar utilized toward the end of pregnancy, it is generally quite\nunnecessary to increase these materials correspondingly in the diet.\nNearly everyone eats more of all the food-stuffs than the body needs.\nIn the case of the prospective mother the surplus ordinarily taken\nmeets every need incident to her additional energy requirements.\nBecause we eat more than we need, someone has said, with as much\ntruth as humor, that prospective mothers \"neither want nor need to\neat for two. The fact is more likely that enough for one is too much\nfor two.\" For the average woman it is wiser to take less during\npregnancy rather than more, for over-indulgence is apt to lead to\nindigestion. The moment when the appetite is satisfied should be\naccepted as the stopping point, and that will be instinctively\nrecognized if one eats deliberately, and thoroughly masticates the\nfood.\n\nRegularity in the hour of eating is always healthful, and for some\nprospective mothers three meals a day prove quite satisfactory. Not a\nfew, however, who adhere to this habit make the mistake of eating\nmore than is wise; and large meals are particularly inappropriate to\npregnancy. On this account most prospective mothers will be more\ncomfortable if they take some simple and wholesome nourishment at\nfixed times between meals. Such an arrangement modifies a ravenous\nappetite, and it is, at the same time, beneficial to those who are\nnot inclined to eat enough at the regular meals. If small amounts of\nfood are taken five or six times a day, a tendency to be nauseated,\nwhich is not uncommon in the early months of pregnancy, can often be\naverted. In the latter months, too, because the capacity of the\nstomach is diminished through the encroachment of the enlarged womb,\nfrequent meals generally contribute toward comfort and health. While\nthe inevitable consequences of overloading the stomach are to be\navoided at all times of the day, it is especially important to\nremember the disagreeable results of a hearty meal at night. The\nevening meal should be a light one and should be eaten three or four\nhours before going to bed.\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF LIQUID NOURISHMENT.--Every prospective mother\nshould have brought to her attention the great importance of drinking\nwater at regular times and in larger quantities than was formerly her\ncustom. Since water constitutes two-thirds of the substance of our\nbodies, it is necessary, of course, for everyone; but during\npregnancy it is especially necessary for the building of new tissue\nand for safeguarding the mother's kidneys. Prospective mothers would\nprotect themselves against a number of ailments if they were more\ncareful to drink a sufficient amount of liquids. They may easily\ndetermine whether they are doing so, for whenever the urine passed\nduring twenty-four hours measures less than a quart, they are not\ndrinking enough. Generally the daily elimination of urine fluctuates\nbetween two and three pints; a larger amount, however, is rather a\nfavorable indication than the reverse.\n\nThe variations in the quantity of liquids that healthy persons drink\nmake it impossible to say just how much anyone should take. It may be\nsaid with confidence, however, that women who are pregnant should\nconsume at least three quarts of fluid every day, and by far the\ngreater portion of this should be water. The rest may be taken in the\nform of milk, soup, cocoa, and chocolate. Against the moderate use of\ntea and coffee no valid objection can be raised; the tradition that\nthey may cause miscarriage is incorrect. For well-known reasons the\nhabitual use of strong tea or coffee is always harmful, and it is,\ntherefore, equally as objectionable during pregnancy as at other\ntimes. Beverages which contain a small percentage of alcohol, such as\nmalt and beer, may or may not be helpful; they should be regarded as\nmedicine, not to be taken without consulting a physician.\n\nTHE CHOICE OF FOOD.--There is no diet specifically adapted to the\nstate of pregnancy; the prospective mother may usually exercise the\nsame freedom as anyone else in the selection of food. She should,\nhowever, choose what will agree with her and avoid that which she\ncannot digest and assimilate. Personal experience in the main must\nguide everyone as to what to eat, and most women may follow the\ndictates of appetite after they become pregnant as safely as they did\nbefore.\n\nIt is true, of course, that careful scientific observations have\ntaught not only what the nutritional requirements of the body are,\nbut also how the diet may be arranged to satisfy these requirements\nmost conscientiously and economically. \"Caloric Feeding\" is the name\ngiven the method which aims to furnish an individual the exact amount\nof food, and usually to furnish it at a minimum cost. Its principles\nare of great practical importance to the commissary of an army or to\nthe purveyor of an institution which provides for large numbers of\npeople; but it is neither necessary nor advisable that the diet of\nany healthy individual be regulated solely with a view to satisfying\nthe actual requirements of his or her body. Food should possess other\nqualities than fuel value: first of all it must be appetizing, for\nappetizing food receives the most thorough digestion.\n\nWe all know how variable are our appetites. What appeals to one will\nnot appeal to another, and frequently the same person has no appetite\nto-day for food that she will eat with relish to-morrow. Precise\nrules, therefore, to guide healthy persons in the selection of their\nfood are not obtainable; neither are they desirable, for the exercise\nof individual preference possesses notable advantages. In order,\nhowever, that there may not also be disadvantages, the prospective\nmother, like anyone else, must be content to choose food that is\nsimple, wholesome, and of such a character that it will not throw an\nundue burden upon the digestive organs.\n\nDuring pregnancy some uncooked food should be eaten every day. Ripe\nfruit answers the purpose admirably. At all seasons of the year fruit\nof one variety or another, such as apples, peaches, apricots, pears,\noranges, figs, cherries, pineapples, grapes, plums, strawberries,\nraspberries, and blackberries may be obtained and should have a place\nin the diet. In making a choice personal taste alone need be\nconsulted.\n\nFruit contains a large proportion of water as compared with other\narticles of diet; and, therefore, is especially capable of quenching\nthirst. Fruit also lessens the desire for sweets, acts as a laxative,\nand furnishes mineral material which the body needs. Its laxative\neffect is most pronounced when it is eaten alone, as, for example, in\nthe morning before breakfast or at night upon going to bed; cooked\nfruit taken with the meals acts much less effectively. Fruit and\nvegetable salads are wholesome, but cannot be recommended\nindiscriminately during pregnancy, for not infrequently the dressing\nused with them causes discomfort. Under these circumstances it is\nobvious that one should do without salads.\n\nThe cereals wheat, corn, rye, oats, and barley are the most prominent\nsource of starch in an ordinary diet. Breakfast foods manufactured\nfrom grain are not only nutritious in themselves, but their value is\nincreased by the milk or cream used with them. Bread is the staple\nstarch-containing food in this country, and starch is our main source\nof energy, but it is necessary to eat only a small quantity of bread,\nif the diet includes a relatively large amount of vegetables. It is\nadvantageous to use bread made from unbolted flour (Graham bread) or\nfrom corn meal, because the coarse undigested residue which they\nleave stimulates the movements of the intestine and assists in\novercoming the constipation which is generally associated with\npregnancy. Pastry must be avoided by those who suffer from\nindigestion; and every prospective mother should eat pastry only\noccasionally, and not very much of it at any time. The best desserts\nare raw and freshly cooked fruit, preserves, gelatin, custard, ice\ncream, and light puddings, such as rice and tapioca.\n\nVegetables should be abundant in the diet of every prospective\nmother. Some of them, however, are digested with difficulty, and on\nthis account cabbage, cauliflower, corn, egg-plant, cucumbers, and\nradishes should be eaten sparingly. Occasionally it will be necessary\nto exclude them from the diet altogether. Other vegetables produce\nflatulence, and for that reason parsnips and beans may cause\ndiscomfort. The prejudice, however, which exists against onions,\nasparagus, and celery should not be heeded; all of them are harmless,\nand celery thoroughly cooked with milk is very wholesome. Besides\nthese, moreover, there are many highly nutritious and easily\ndigestible vegetables which can be freely recommended, such as both\nsweet and white potatoes, rice, peas, lima beans, tomatoes, beets,\ncarrots, string beans, spinach, Brussels sprouts, and lettuce.\n\nVegetable food contains all the material necessary to sustain life,\nand some persons prefer to adhere strictly to a vegetarian diet. Most\nprospective mothers, however, find a mixed diet more agreeable, and\nthis is sufficient reason for using it. Furthermore, no fair\nobjection can be raised against the use of animal food, provided the\npregnancy is normal. It is important, nevertheless, to remember that\nmeat contains protein in concentrated amounts, and that meat once a\nday answers every need not only of the mother but also of the growing\nfetus.\n\nThe ideal animal foods are milk and eggs; they contain every\ningredient necessary to repair old and to form new tissues. But\nusually the prospective mother may have any animal food she wishes:\nbeef, veal, lamb, poultry, game, fish, oysters, and clams. The\nrelatively large fat-content of pork, goose, and duck renders them\nindigestible for some persons, who, of course, should not eat them.\n\nFrom what we have learned about foods in general and their relation\nto pregnancy it is clear that the question so often asked by\nprospective mothers, \"Are there any special directions regarding my\ndiet?\" may be briefly answered as follows: Under no circumstances is\nthe need of food increased in the first half of pregnancy. During the\nlast two or three months, while the most notable growth of the fetus\nis in progress, there is a perceptible increase in the amount of\nenergy expended by the mother, and this may be readily supplied by a\nglass of milk or some equally simple nourishment between meals.\nFurthermore, throughout pregnancy, most women are made most\ncomfortable by frequent small meals; they will almost certainly\nsuffer discomfort if heavy meals are eaten three times a day.\n\nThe most nearly ideal diet consists of very little meat and a\ncomparatively rich allowance of vegetables and fruit. The food should\nbe chosen with regard to individual appetite and should be varied\nfrequently. Thorough mastication always increases the efficiency of a\ndiet. Thus the food will be most perfectly mixed with saliva and\nbroken into fragments which can be readily attacked by the digestive\njuices of the stomach and the intestines.\n\nCRAVINGS.--There is a well-known tradition that women who are\npregnant are subject to longings for one article of diet or another,\nand that unless the desire be promptly gratified the child will be\n\"marked.\" In the light of what has already been said regarding\nmaternal impressions, this evidently is nonsense. A prospective\nmother, like anyone else, does frequently desire one article of food\nmore than another. So long as the object of her wish is not obviously\nharmful, it should be granted; but if it is not granted no harm will\ncome to the child.\n\nRemarkable instances in which disgusting substances have been craved\nand eaten are often talked about and have even found their way into\npopular novels. The unfortunate victims of these unnatural cravings\nare not of sound mind. With reference to them a physician of\nunusually broad experience wrote fifty years ago, \"I have never met\nwith any example of this sort; which leads me to infer that these\nlongings are more frequent in books than in the practice of our art.\"\nThis conclusion is even more fully justified to-day than when\noriginally expressed.\n\nTHE RELATION BETWEEN THE MOTHER'S DIET AND THE SIZE OF THE CHILD.--\nWith the beginning of careful, scientific study of the nutritional\nproblems of pregnancy, investigators were interested to learn the\nsource of the material which was used to build up the child's body.\nTwo possibilities suggested themselves: one that the material came\nfrom the mother's food and the other that it was derived from her own\nflesh. In order to determine which of these methods was the natural\none, animal experimentation was resorted to and gave identical\nresults in the hands of independent observers. It was found, as I\nhave already stated, that the same diet which had previously kept an\nanimal's weight constant was sufficient to meet her requirements\nduring pregnancy and also to provide for the growth of her offspring.\nThe mother animal was actually found somewhat heavier at the\ntermination of pregnancy than at the beginning. It seemed fair to\nconclude, therefore, that nutrition had proceeded along more economic\nlines, and that under these conditions the customary diet had\nfurnished the material for the formation of the young. Still other\nobservations indicated that, if the food is not sufficient for both\nmother and offspring, it is Nature's plan to protect the young and\nleave the mother's wants incompletely satisfied. On the other hand,\nwhen an unnecessarily large amount of nourishment is taken, the\nexcess is stored partly in the young, and partly in the mother's\nbody.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the results of such observations upon\nanimals are applicable to human beings. Everyone familiar with the\npractice of obstetrics knows that women who gratify enormous\nappetites during pregnancy, especially if they also fail to take\nexercise, give birth to large children. On the other hand, it is said\nthat children born during times of famine are frequently delivered\nprematurely, or, if mature, they are small and puny. A similar though\nmuch less marked contrast exists between the babies of the working\nclasses and the well-to-do, and clearly indicates that the weight of\nthe baby varies directly with the food of the mother.\n\nThe quantity of the food is more influential than its quality, though\nthe latter is also a factor in determining the size of the child. An\nexcessive amount of starch or sugar in the mother's diet is stored as\nfat in the child. On this account it is reasonable to eat sparingly\nof candy, cake, and other sweets; but further attempts to reduce the\nweight of the fetus by discrimination against different articles of\nfood are not advisable.\n\nThe various theories that have been advanced with a view to reducing\nthe size of the child are impracticable; some of them, rigidly\ncarried out, would actually jeopardize the health of both beings. All\nof them are designed to make the infant's bones soft and to diminish\nthe fat in its body. To this end, generally about two months before\nthe expected date of birth, the mother's diet is arranged to consist\nchiefly of meat; and as far as possible she is denied candy, sweet\ndesserts, soup, bread, cereals, vegetables, and water. Such a diet\noverlooks, among other things, the tremendous importance of liquids\nto the woman who is pregnant. Certainly its indiscriminate use would\nresult in far more harm than good; and no one should adopt it without\nminute directions from a physician.\n\nAttempts to make the infant's bones soft by limiting the mother to\nfood containing extremely small amounts of lime and other minerals\nare also unnatural, for we have learned that whenever the mother's\nfood fails to contain the material the fetus requires the mother's\ntissues are called upon to supply it. Under these conditions,\ntherefore, her bones will give up their lime.\n\nIt is of the very first importance that the mother's nourishment be\ncorrect from the standpoint of her own requirements, and such\ntreatment will also redound most beneficially to the child. She\nshould never fall, however, into the error of over-eating, which will\nnot benefit her and will cause unnecessary growth of the fetus. On\nthe other hand, there can be no justification for measures that tend\nto weaken her. She may be careful, in other words, to avoid over-\ngrowth of the fetus, but should not adopt a diet so restricted as to\ninterfere with normal development. So long as her health is\nsuccessfully maintained, she may give herself no concern as to what\nthe size of the child is likely to be. That is a detail which\nconcerns her physician, and which will be observed by him several\nweeks before the expected date of birth.",

        "content": "THE CARE OF THE BODY\n\nThe Bowels--The Kidneys--The Skin--Bathing--Douches--Clothing--\nCorsets--The Breasts.\n\nIf we stop to think it is only too apparent that the human body is a\nmachine. We seize energy in one form and convert it into another,\njust as truly as do the windmill, the locomotive, and the dynamo. In\nthe case of the human machine, the latent energy of the food is\nturned into the various activities of everyday life. Our bodies\nutilize their fuel more perfectly than any machine that man has\ninvented; but they fail, nevertheless, to do so completely. And just\nas the efficiency of an engine cannot be maintained unless the smoke\nescapes and the ashes are raked away, so no human being can enjoy\nhealth unless his waste products are promptly removed. The task of\nremoval, as most of us know, is assumed by our excretory organs,\nwhich include the bowels, the kidneys, the skin, and the lungs.\n\nDuring pregnancy the mother must get rid not only of her own waste\nproducts, but also of those of the child. The waste products of the\nchild, if weighed, would not amount to a great deal; but they are by\nno means negligible. So far as we can tell, it is chiefly on account\nof their peculiar character that they increase the work of the\nmother's excretory organs. Whatever the cause, they do increase it,\nand experience has taught us that these organs must always be kept in\na healthful condition to protect both the mother and the child from\nharm. Consequently a prospective mother who wishes to take proper\ncare of her body must, in the first place, direct her attention\ntoward keeping up the normal activity of all the excretory functions.\n\nTHE BOWELS.--While pregnant, nine out of ten women suffer from mild\nconstipation. Those who have been previously troubled with this\ncomplaint may find it aggravated from the outset, but in most\ninstances it does not appear until after several months have passed.\nConstipation is explained by the fact that the enlarged womb presses\nagainst the intestines; and, as the enlargement increases,\nconstipation generally becomes more pronounced. No doubt there was a\ntime when women, perhaps unconsciously, counteracted this natural\nresult of pregnancy by the use of a diet consisting largely of fruit\nand vegetables and also by outdoor exercise. Such measures, indeed,\nstill afford the simplest means of overcoming constipation.\n\nThroughout pregnancy the bowels should move at least once every day.\nWhen they do not, some of the waste material that should be removed\nis absorbed by the body and seeks to leave it through the organs that\nare already doing their full share of work. For example, under such\nconditions, the kidneys, instead of exerting themselves more\nvigorously, may become less active than they were.\n\nIt is everyone's duty to form the habit of having the bowels move\nregularly. Now the most favorable opportunity for assisting the\nintestines to empty themselves occurs shortly after meal-time, since\nthe involuntary movements of the intestines are most active while\ndigestion is in progress. It should be regarded as an imperative\nduty, therefore, to grant Nature such an opportunity every morning\njust after breakfast. This should be done at a definite hour, day\nafter day, even though the inclination is absent; and in many\ninstances the desired habit will be formed.\n\nA glass of water on going to bed or on getting up has a laxative\neffect; and there are other dietary measures which may be employed\nwith advantage. Thus, coarseness of the food, as we know, stimulates\nintestinal activity, and this fact explains the peculiar value of\nGraham bread, bran bread, and corn bread. Fresh fruit and vegetables\ncounteract constipation for two reasons, namely, because they leave\nin the bowels a relatively large amount of undigested substance, and\nbecause they contain ingredients that have a specific purgative\naction. Such ingredients are especially noteworthy in rhubarb,\ntomatoes, apples, peaches, pears, figs, prunes, and berries.\n\nEnemas used as a routine measure are mischievous. They interfere with\nthe \"tone\" of the bowel-muscle so that it acts sluggishly and bring\nabout a condition in which the bowels will not move without\nartificial stimulation. At best these irrigations remove no more than\nthe contents of the lower bowel, and should be employed only when\nthere is acute and urgent need of clearing out the rectum.\n\nObstinate constipation is uncommon, and strong purgatives are seldom\nneeded. If they become necessary, a physician should be consulted as\nto what to take. Whenever dietary measures and exercise, which is\ndiscussed in the next chapter, fail to counteract the natural\ntendency toward constipation, the prospective mother may generally\nresort to \"senna prunes\" or some equally simple and harmless\nhousehold remedy. Senna prunes are prepared as follows: Place an\nounce of dried senna leaves in a jar and pour a quart of boiling\nwater on them. Allow to stand two or three hours; strain off the\nleaves and throw them away. To the liquor add a pound of prunes.\nCover and place on the back of the stove, allowing to simmer until\nhalf the liquor has boiled away. Add a pint of water and sweeten to\ntaste, preferably with brown sugar. The prunes should be eaten with\nthe evening meal. The number required must be learned from\nexperience. Begin with half a dozen, and increase or decrease the\nnumber, as required. The syrup is an even stronger laxative than the\nprunes.\n\nTHE KIDNEYS.--Any one may judge for herself whether or not the bowels\nare doing their work satisfactorily, but not so with the kidneys. For\nthis purpose the urine must be examined by a physician. In spite of\nthis fact, considerable responsibility rests upon the prospective\nmother, whose duty it is to collect the specimens properly--a detail\nthat is apt to be neglected. It is impossible to urge too strongly\nthe importance of saving, at regular intervals, all the urine passed\nin twenty-four hours, of protecting it from decomposition, and of\nsending a sample to the physician. The intervals may be longer at\nfirst, for the kidneys have very little extra work to do until the\nsixth month. Usually, therefore, it is a satisfactory plan to send a\nsample for analysis the first of each month during the early half of\npregnancy; but during the latter half one should be sent the first\nand the fifteenth of each month.\n\nTo estimate the exact amount of urine passed in twenty-four hours and\nto protect it properly, in the first place, the vessel in which it\nwill be collected should be carefully scalded out. As a further\nprecaution against decomposition, add a teaspoonful of chloroform to\nthe vessel, which should be kept covered, and not allowed to stand in\na warm room. Unless these details are conscientiously observed,\nputrefaction may take place and vitiate the analysis the physician\nwishes to make. The precise amount of urine which the kidneys excrete\nin twenty-four hours will be determined as follows: At a convenient\ntime, for example at 8 A.M., empty the bladder and throw the urine\naway; this marks the beginning of the observation. Subsequently, save\nall the urine passed during the day and night, and finally at 8\no'clock the next morning empty the bladder and add this urine to that\npreviously collected. The total amount, thus collected, should be\nmeasured.\n\nIt is unnecessary to send all the urine to the physician; six ounces,\nsomewhat less than half a pint, will be enough. But the physician\nshould know what the total amount was found to be; therefore, a\nrecord of the measurement, the date, and the patient's name should\naccompany the sample. If limited to a single fact about the urine, it\nwould be most helpful to know the amount passed during the twenty-\nfour hours. In this way, as I have already pointed out, the patient\nherself may derive valuable information, for if the urine is scanty\nin amount--that is, less than a quart--she should drink more water.\n\nUnscrupulous newspaper advertisements alarm people through incorrect\nstatements about trouble with the kidneys. For example, they declare\nthat a sediment in the urine is a sign of disease; but that is false.\nThe mere act of cooling sometimes causes substances to crystallize\nout of perfectly normal urine. Or, putrefactive changes which\nfrequently take place after the urine has stood for a time may cause\nsome of its normal constituents to be precipitated. A sediment,\neither white, pink, or yellow, may indicate that the urine is too\nconcentrated, and consequently means that the individual should drink\nwater more freely; but it generally means nothing more serious. The\nreally important abnormal constituents of the urine, namely, albumin\nand sugar, never form a sediment.\n\n\"Pain in the back\" is a complaint frequently used to defraud the\npublic. This symptom does not indicate Bright's disease. It is\ngenerally due to the muscles far away from the kidneys, with which,\nusually, the pain has nothing whatever to do. Similarly a desire to\npass the urine frequently does not indicate any disturbance of kidney\nfunction, but is explained by the pressure of the enlarged womb\nagainst the bladder; it is a very annoying, yet a natural, result of\npregnancy.\n\nTHE SKIN.--The functions of the skin are at the very foundation of\nhealth. It protects the delicate structures which it covers, assists\nin the regulation of the temperature of the body, and excretes waste\nproducts. The excretory function of the skin is always active, but we\nare unconscious of this activity except on warm days and at times\nwhen we perspire freely. In the coldest weather, however, the body\nthrows off what physiologists call the \"insensible perspiration.\" The\nmost important measures for the care of the skin are those intended\nto insure the activity of the sweat glands, namely, bathing and\nproper clothing. But before considering these measures, we will\ndescribe certain alterations in the skin which cannot escape the\nnotice of the prospective mother, and which she is likely to\nmisinterpret.\n\nOn account of the growth of the uterus the abdominal wall is\nstretched during pregnancy. To a certain degree the skin yields to\nthe distention, but it finally cracks, and lines appear which are\ncommonly called \"pregnancy streaks.\" At first they are delicate and\npink or blue in color; later they become white and more extensive.\n\nThe streaks indicate the situation of small breaks in the deeper\nlayer of the skin, which is less elastic than the upper layer. They\nare not painful, and should never cause anxiety. Their size and\nnumber vary with the degree of abdominal distention, which in turn\ndepends upon various factors, such as the size of the child and the\nquantity of amniotic fluid. Although these streaks are most\nfrequently located upon the lower part of the abdomen, they may\nextend to the outer sides of the thighs; and occasionally appear over\nthe breasts, since they too enlarge during pregnancy. Stretching of\nthe skin, of course, is not confined to pregnancy; consequently, the\nsame kind of streaks often appear in people who are growing stout.\n\nAttempts to prevent or limit the pregnancy streaks prove futile.\nThere is a common belief that they may be prevented by the use of\nvaselin, goose-grease, mutton-fat, or some one of a variety of\nlotions; but this teaching is not borne out by experience. None of\nthese applications, however, are harmful, and there can be no\nobjection to using them except that they cause needless soiling of\nthe clothing. After the child is born the streaks fade of their own\naccord, though they rarely disappear entirely.\n\nIn certain localities the skin grows darker during pregnancy. We have\nalready referred to the deepening of the color around the nipple as\none of the signs of pregnancy; a similar but much less pronounced\ndiscoloration occurs about the navel, which also becomes shallow and\nmay begin to pout in the latter months of pregnancy. About this time,\nwith very few exceptions, there appears a more or less intense brown\nline which runs downward from the navel in the middle of the abdomen.\nSometimes, though not very often, small dark areas, which have been\ncalled \"liver spots,\" appear elsewhere over the body. The name is\nunfortunate, for the spots do not indicate a disorder of the liver.\n\nAt present it is generally admitted that alterations in the color of\nthe skin during pregnancy are due to deposits of iron. This mineral\nsubstance, among others, as we have learned, is required for the\ndevelopment of the embryo. The child is born with a supply of iron\ncalculated to meet its needs for about a year. Such a reserve is\nnecessary, as Bunge has pointed out, because human milk does not\ncontain enough iron to satisfy the infant's requirements. During\npregnancy, therefore, the mother's blood transports iron to the\nplacenta, where it can be absorbed into the child's system; and while\nbeing thus transported some of it is deposited in the maternal\ntissues. The deposits are especially frequent, as I have mentioned,\nin the middle line of the abdomen, on account of the arrangement of\nthe blood vessels there. Deposits elsewhere may depend upon other\nconditions; but whatever their cause the pigmentation vanishes a\nshort time after the birth.\n\nAlterations in the color of the skin have no effect upon its\nexcretory function, which, indeed, generally becomes more active\nduring pregnancy. According to one estimate, the average person\npossesses twenty-eight miles of sweat glands. If these figures are\nnot sufficient to demonstrate the importance of the skin as an\nexcretory organ, surely no one will fail to be impressed by the\ntragic result which in one case followed throwing all the sweat\nglands out of action. This was brought about in the case of a young\nboy whose body was covered with gold leaf to provide entertainment at\na Parisian festival. The living statue was not exhibited, however,\nfor shortly after the youth was gilded he became ill and died.\n\nIn health more than a pint of water is eliminated through the skin\nevery day, and along with it waste products are removed from the\nbody. Exercise, hot drinks, warm weather, and heavy clothing promote\nthe activity of the sweat glands. Under certain circumstances\nphysicians endeavor to relieve the kidneys by stimulating their\npatients to perspire freely. It should be clear, therefore, that when\na prospective mother naturally perspires it is a good indication.\nAttempts to stop the perspiration are always ill advised; rather\nshould this function be encouraged by keeping the skin in good\ncondition with baths and warm clothing.\n\nBATHING.--The accumulation of dead skin, grease, dust, and dried\nperspiration on the surface of the body hinders the actions of the\nsweat glands. Some of this material is wiped off by the clothing, and\nmore of it is removed by washing with plain water; but the most\neffectual cleansing results from a liberal use of warm water and\nsoap.\n\nSince the prospective mother must throw off the waste products of the\nembryo as well as those of her own body, it is obvious that\ncleanliness is never more important than during pregnancy. For this\nreason she should take a tepid tub bath or shower every day. It is\nnot necessary that the temperature of the bath be determined with\naccuracy or that it be always the same; but generally a temperature\nbetween 80 and 90 degrees F. is found most agreeable. At this\ntemperature a bath is termed \"indifferent,\" because it is neither\nstimulating nor depressing; it is employed purely for cleansing the\nbody. Every part of the body should be well soaped, and from ten to\nfifteen minutes should be given to washing all the exposed surfaces.\nThe best time for such a bath is just before going to bed, though\nthere is no objection to taking it during the day, provided that two\nhours have passed since the last meal, and that another hour is\npermitted to elapse before one goes out of doors or undertakes anything\nthat requires exertion.\n\nProlonged hot baths are fatiguing. They draw the blood from the\ninterior to the surface of the body; and during pregnancy they are\nparticularly depressing. Vapor and steam baths have a similar action\nand should never be taken without the consent of a physician. They\nserve admirably for the treatment of rare complications of pregnancy;\nbut, like medicine, their use should be limited to cases in which\nthey are clearly indicated.\n\nUnless disagreeable results are noticed, those who have become\naccustomed to cold baths may continue to take them during pregnancy,\nbut others should not. If, however, the temperature of the water is\nmodified so that it will not produce a shock, no one need omit the\nmorning plunge or shower which most persons find invigorating.\nSponging answers the same purpose, for the intent of the morning bath\nis not to cleanse the body but to arouse the circulation. A thorough\nrub-down assists in bringing the blood to the surface of the body.\nBath and massage together thus constitute a kind of skin gymnastics\nespecially beneficial throughout pregnancy.\n\nAlthough hot foot-baths have sometimes been thought to cause\nmiscarriage, there is no good reason for believing they ever do. Sea-\nbathing, on the contrary, may be directly responsible for such a\nmishap. It is true that pregnant women sometimes indulge in surf-\nbathing without harmful results; nevertheless the danger of\nmiscarriage they assume is not slight. The shock of the low\ntemperature, the exertion required to keep a firm footing, and the\npounding of the surf against the abdomen are all unfavorable\ninfluences which more than counterbalance any advantage of such a\nbath. On the other hand, there is slight risk if any in bathing in a\nquiet stream or lake.\n\nDOUCHES.--A great many women have the conviction that the vagina is\nnot clean and should, therefore, be regularly cleansed by means of\nirrigations. This assumption is false and the treatment based upon it\nis unnecessary. In structure the walls of the vagina closely resemble\nthe skin, but unlike the skin they do not contain glands; the vagina,\ntherefore, has nothing to do with the elimination of waste products\nfrom the body. The secretion which issues from the vagina really\noriginates in the glands around the mouth of the womb, and serves to\nprotect the birth-canal against infection from harmful bacteria.\n\nCareful examinations have shown that under normal conditions, which\nof course include pregnancy, disease-producing bacteria are absent\nfrom the vagina; in this respect the vagina is even cleaner than the\nskin, for disease-producing bacteria are present on the surface of\nthe body. The vaginal secretion becomes more abundant during\npregnancy, and the increase is interpreted as an additional guarantee\nagainst infection at the time of labor. So far as possible,\ntherefore, this natural antiseptic should not be disturbed.\n\nThe advice to abstain from douches will not be adopted by every\nprospective mother without protest, for, as I have said, many women\nregard them as necessary to cleanliness. Others who have delicate\nskins are occasionally annoyed by the irritation of the vaginal\nsecretion, which is not only increased during pregnancy but has a\nmore pronouncedly acid character. Under extraordinary circumstances,\nit may be permissible to use douches in the early part of pregnancy,\nbut it is practically never advisable to do so during the month\npreceding the expected date of confinement. Furthermore, at no time\nshould the use of douches be begun without consulting a physician.\n\nA more rational hygienic measure for the relief of itching and\nsmarting about the vaginal orifice consists in removing the secretion\nas soon as it appears. In other words, the external parts should be\nkept clean and dry. Great comfort is often derived from the use of a\n\"sitz-bath,\" which may be easily prepared by placing a small tub upon\na low stool and pouring in warm water (about 90 degrees F.) until it\nis five or six inches deep. Cold sitz-baths are useful in the treatment\nof hemorrhoids. Whether the bath be hot or cold, the treatment should\ncontinue from ten to fifteen minutes, and after it the skin should be\nthoroughly dried.\n\nA special form of tub, called a \"bidet,\" has been devised to\nfacilitate bathing the parts in question. The device is convenient\nbut expensive, and is certainly not essential. Every purpose will be\nserved by the small tub, provided the desired temperature of the bath\nis properly maintained by changing the water as may be necessary.\n\nCLOTHING.--In these days at least it is not idle to remark that the\nfirst use of clothes is to keep the body warm; all other services\nthey are made to perform are secondary and relatively unimportant.\nThere are very good reasons, to be sure, for dressing neatly and even\nfor dressing in accord with the fashion, so long as the prevailing\nstyles are not harmful. Odd as it may seem, these are matters which\nare not without significance for the physical well-being of a\nprospective mother. Neat and comfortable clothing will help her to\novercome a natural inclination to become a \"stay-at-home,\" and on\nthis account an inconspicuous way of dressing is often more valuable\nthan medicine. So long as they do not attract attention, most\nprospective mothers go out in the day time, mingle with their\nacquaintances, and attend public places of amusement. Deference to\nfashion, therefore, may contribute substantially to good health.\n\nYet no prospective mother can afford to forget that first of all her\nclothing must keep the body warm. Our clothing confines a cushion of\nair which prevents the escape of the heat that we generate. Now,\nsince dry air conducts heat poorly and moist air conducts it readily,\nthe underclothes should be made of material that absorbs the\nperspiration; otherwise the heat that the body generates is quickly\nlost. Woolen garments effectually absorb the perspiration and should\nbe given the preference. Most persons who cannot wear wool next the\nskin must choose cotton, since silk and linen are much more\nexpensive; there is not in this, however, a serious deprivation.\nCotton undergarments are perfectly hygienic; adapting their weight to\nthe season of the year, one will find them equally satisfactory in\nsummer and winter.\n\nExcept in summer every inch of the body should be covered with the\nunderclothing; this means that high-neck and long-sleeve shirts and\nlong drawers should be worn, for healthful activity of the skin can\nthus be best preserved. It is well known to physicians who practice\nobstetrics that the kidneys fail in their work more frequently during\nthe winter than the summer. To my mind, this is chiefly explained by\nthe way women dress. Even with light clothing the sweat glands\nrespond actively to the heat of summer and thus relieve the kidneys,\nbut in cold weather the sweat glands will not remove their share of\nthe waste products unless the clothing is warm.\n\nNature generally indicates that the body should be kept warm during\npregnancy. Many prospective mothers complain of perspiring freely;\nothers, if reproached because they are not clad warmly enough, reply\nthat they must wear light clothing to keep from perspiring. Thus they\ndiscount or render absolutely ineffective a most important natural\nsafeguard against serious complications. It cannot be too strongly\nemphasized that warm clothing helps to maintain healthful activity of\nthe kidneys quite as much as a proper amount of exercise and the\ndrinking of a suitable quantity of water.\n\nThe texture of the outer garments should take into account this same\nquality of warmth; in other respects in selecting them personal taste\nis an excellent guide. Outfitters carry a variety of maternity\ngarments; patterns for such garments are also sold by dealers, so\nthat those who cannot afford the ready-made clothes will find it easy\nto have them made at home. Alterations in the clothing are compulsory\nas pregnancy advances, and should be timely, made in anticipation of\ninevitable development rather than in response to it. No prospective\nmother need go to the extreme of \"Reform Clothes\"; her apparel should\nillustrate both her good sense and her personal pride.\n\nIt is obviously even more harmful during pregnancy than at other\ntimes to cramp the body by the clothing; the chest and the abdomen,\nthe parts most likely to be compressed, are at such times most in\nneed of freedom. To a slight degree natural causes always compress\nthe chest from below upward; and on this account nothing should be\nallowed to hamper the expansion of the lungs from side to side. On\nthe other hand, if the waist is constricted, not the breathing\nmovements alone but also the growth of the womb will be interfered\nwith. In order to avoid such disagreeable consequences, and at the\nsame time to limit the extent of the maternity wardrobe, skirts may\nbe fitted with practical devices which permit letting out the\nwaistband as occasion demands. So far as possible, however, all the\nclothing should be hung from the shoulders, and under no\ncircumstances should heavy skirts be worn.\n\nShoes contribute toward health, or the lack of it, more significantly\nthan the average person realizes. It is particularly advisable that\nprospective mothers should select foot-wear with care, because their\nbodies are heavier than usual. The feet are apt to become swollen in\nthe latter months of pregnancy, and consequently the shoes should be\nroomy, but should always fit. To escape the discomfort of tight\nshoes, it is generally advisable to wear a shoe an inch longer and\nbroader than the foot at rest.\n\nHigh heels have been proved a frequent cause of back-ache; half of\nsuch cases, in all probability, may be thus explained. High heels\ntilt the body forward in such a way that the erect posture can be\nmaintained only by an unnatural tenseness of the back-muscles. Some\nstrain of this kind is inevitable during the latter months of\npregnancy on account of the enlargement and the position of the womb;\nit is reasonable, therefore, to minimize it by wearing low, broad\nheels.\n\nBesides being responsible for many cases of backache, high heels add\ngreatly to the danger of tripping and falling; for this reason alone\nthey should not be worn. Improper foot-gear and not the joints\nthemselves deserve the blame for weak ankles. To prevent \"turning the\nankle,\" it is not necessary to restrict oneself to high shoes, but\nmerely to see that the shoes that are worn have low heels and broad\nsoles. Such shoes provide a sure, firm footing, and this the\nprospective mother particularly needs.\n\nCORSETS.--No question connected with women's dress has provoked so\nmuch discussion as the use of corsets. \"Are corsets necessary to\nhealth?\" has been differently answered by those who would appear to\nbe equally competent authorities. In the time of our savage ancestors\nwe may safely conclude that they were not used; and, therefore, it is\nreally a question as to whether their continued use for generation\nafter generation has finally made some support of this kind\nindispensable to the average woman. While that matter has not as yet\nbeen settled, it is obvious that custom is really responsible for the\nconviction of many women that they appear slovenly without corsets.\nOn the other hand, not a few women, unmindful of fashion, never wear\nthem; they testify that they are healthier for doing so. Whether this\nbe true or not, no one can honestly believe that corsets will soon be\nbanished; and the practical problem is to distinguish between those\nthat may do good and those certain to do harm.\n\nDuring pregnancy the abdomen tends to fall forward and slightly\ndownward, and though it is in pregnancies after the first that this\ntendency is most marked, every prospective mother will be more\ncomfortable if she wears some sort of support to counteract what\nphysicians term a \"pendulous abdomen.\" Such a condition can be\nprevented by the use of several appliances, and the device best\nsuited to the case should be chosen. Those who have never become\naccustomed to corsets will probably find a corset-waist or an\nabdominal supporter the most comfortable and useful. But the average\nyoung woman who has previously employed a sensible, well made, and\nloosely fitting corset need make no change until the third or fourth\nmonth of pregnancy. From then on she should wear a corset especially\ndesigned to conform with the changes that naturally occur in the\nfigure.\n\nThere is a plan, wrong in principle, which many adopt. Reasoning that\nit will be necessary to change the corset from time to time, and\ndesiring to practice economy, a number of women purchase the cheapest\ncorset at hand. This they replace with a larger one of the same style\nfrom time to time. The result is that an improperly fitting garment\nis worn continuously; and, in the end, this plan proves almost as\nexpensive as, and far less suitable than, a proper corset, which\nwould remain serviceable throughout pregnancy, or at least until a\nfew weeks before confinement.\n\nMost, and probably all, of the injuries for which corsets are\nresponsible result from their misuse. Naturally serious consequences\nmay be expected if they are worn with the design of compressing the\nabdomen so as to render pregnancy less noticeable or perhaps to\nconceal it altogether. Thus worn, the corset becomes not only an\ninstrument of torture but a source of danger both to the mother and\nto the child. Fortunately there are very few women who fail to\nappreciate the risk of thus striving to disguise their condition; and\ngenerally it is the needless discomfort, the trifling ills\nthoughtlessly inflicted upon themselves, that prospective mothers\nmust be taught to avoid.\n\nAt present there are manufactured a number of excellent maternity\ncorsets; but there are also worthless types, and some likely to do\nharm. To judge them fairly they must be examined with regard to\nseveral requirements. In the first place the corset should not be\nstiff and should always be capable of easy adjustment; it must never\ninterfere with the activity of any organ. As _enceinte_, the\nFrench word meaning pregnant, signifies, the prospective mother\nshould be unbound. Tight clothing, as we have already remarked,\nhinders the breathing movements; it also interferes with the action\nof the heart, and occasionally causes the child to assume an\nunfavorable position within the uterus. The adjustment of the\nmaternity corset to the progressive development of the body is\ngenerally provided for by means of extra lacings down the sides, and\nby the insertion of elastic material.\n\nThe maternity corset, in the next place, must support the enlarged\nuterus. Correctly shaped and worn, it extends well down in front,\nfits snugly around the hips, and arches forward so as to conform to\nthe curve of the abdomen. In place of the arching, or \"cupping\" as\nmanufacturers call it, some maternity corsets have attached to their\nlower edge limp flaps of a strong fabric which lace together. The\nmaternity corset-waist also should extend well under the abdomen and\nfit snugly around the hips.\n\nFinally, the corset should support the bust; the unpleasant\nsensations due to congestion of the breasts can be relieved most\nsuccessfully by elevating them. It is exceedingly important, however,\nthat the upper part of the corset should fit loosely, for otherwise\nthe development of the breasts may be hindered, and the nipples\ndepressed. As a further precaution against pressure above and also to\nsecure the proper amount of support below, it is generally advisable\nto begin putting on the corset while lying down. In every case the\ncorset should be laced from below upward; if laced in the opposite\ndirection it fails to lift the womb and tends to push all the\nabdominal organs downward.\n\nAny kind of corset is likely to become uncomfortable toward the end\nof pregnancy; and of course should then be discarded. An abdominal\nsupporter made of woven linen or rubber is frequently used to\nadvantage during the last three or four weeks. With the first\npregnancy the supporter is rarely necessary, but with subsequent ones\nit is frequently useful as early as the sixth month and is\nindispensable later. A substitute for the manufactured supporter can\nbe made at home. Some such device often facilitates turning in bed,\nand on that account may be found even more useful at night than\nduring the day.\n\nTHE BREASTS.--Personal hygiene during pregnancy includes the\npreparation of the breasts with a view to success in nursing. All\nmeasures which promote the health of a prospective mother also serve\nto equip her for the nursing period; and in that sense the directions\njust given for the care of the body, as well as the rules to follow\nin the next chapter regarding a wholesome way of living, bear\ndirectly upon lactation. But there are also local measures to be\nadopted, some of which, such as supporting the breasts and avoiding\nconstriction by the clothing, have already been mentioned. Finally,\nthe nipples must be toughened and, if short or flat, they must be\ndrawn out, for the best supply of milk will count for nothing if the\ninfant cannot nurse comfortably.\n\nSome approved method of toughening the nipples so that they will not\nbe injured by the sucking efforts of the infant, no matter how\nvigorous, should be begun eight weeks before the expected date of\nconfinement; to start earlier will do no harm, but it is quite\nunnecessary. A number of procedures have been advocated, but in my\nown experience the following simple method is the best. The nipples\nare scrubbed for five minutes, night and morning, with soap and warm\nwater. Generally, a soft brush, such as a complexion-brush, is\nsatisfactory; but if this is too harsh, at first a wash cloth may be\nused. After having been thoroughly scrubbed the nipples are anointed\nwith lanolin and covered with a small square of clean, old linen to\nprevent soiling of the clothing.\n\nAnother method widely used, but somewhat less trustworthy, consists\nin bathing the nipples and applying a dilute solution of alcohol.\nFormerly brandy, whiskey, or cologne were recommended, but at present\nthe following solution is commonly used. A tablespoonful of powdered\nboric acid is added to three ounces of water and thoroughly mixed.\nThis is poured into a six-ounce bottle, which is then filled with\ngrain alcohol (95 per cent). The solution is applied twice a day with\na small piece of absorbent cotton.\n\nWell-formed nipples need only be toughened, but depressed nipples\nrequire additional treatment; and this should be begun about the\nmiddle of pregnancy. The old-fashioned way of making the nipple more\nprominent was to cover it with the mouth of a bottle which had\npreviously been warmed. The vacuum created, as the bottle cooled,\ndrew the nipple out. Similarly, the bowl of a clay pipe was sometimes\nplaced over the nipple; the patient sucked the stem, the nipple was\ndrawn into the bowl, and with persistence day after day success was\noften attained. A similar and somewhat more aesthetic procedure is\nnow employed. The nipple is seized between the thumb and finger and\nalternately pulled out and allowed to retract. These manipulations,\nif faithfully practiced for several months, generally make the nipple\nprominent enough for the infant to grasp. Occasionally patients need\nto wear a contrivance sold at instrument stores which consists of a\ncircular piece of wood modeled to fit the breast and perforated in\nthe middle to accommodate the nipple. The appliance should not be\nused unless a physician thinks it necessary.\n\nDirections regarding the care of the breasts are sometimes taken\nlightly, yet such care is not a minor duty. Now and then a patient\nwill pass through pregnancy uneventfully, will be delivered without\ndifficulty, and will enter upon what promises to be a rapid\nconvalescence when her recovery is interrupted by the development of\ninflammation of the breast. Because such a complication may be\nprevented, its appearance is the more to be regretted. Furthermore,\nthe responsibility for its prevention usually rests with the patient\nherself. If she has been conscientious in preparing the nipples and\ncontinues to watch them throughout the nursing period, the annoyance\nof an abscess will almost certainly be prevented.",

        "content": "GENERAL HYGIENIC MEASURES\n\nThe Need of Fresh Air--Outdoor Exercise--Massage and Gymnastics--The\nInfluence of Work upon Pregnancy--Relaxation and Rest--Is Traveling\nHarmful?--Mental Diversion.\n\nBesides the hygienic measures described in the preceding chapter,\nwhose observance should be recognized as more or less obligatory,\nthere are more general questions of conduct, such as exercise,\nrelaxation, mental occupation, and amusement, which are also\nimportant. These measures, although frequently determined merely by\npersonal inclination or by the force of circumstances, nevertheless\nexert a tremendous influence upon health. This fact a prospective\nmother is likely to realize, for she is certain to consider not only\nher own welfare but also that of the expected child; and she is\nconsequently concerned about details of conduct that most persons\nwould regard as trivial. She may, indeed, be too conscientious. Well-\nmeaning friends, sometimes in reply to her questions and sometimes\nwithout solicitation, offer her a great deal of advice. Their\ncounsel, aside from the fact that some of it may be misleading, may\nhave the effect of prescribing so many rules that, if she followed\nthem all, she would never lose sight of the fact that she is\npregnant. Such a degree of self-consciousness is certain to make her\nunduly apprehensive. The proper attitude of mind is quite the\nopposite; so far as possible the prospective mother should forget\nthat she is pregnant. This state of mind is really the more rational,\nfor if a woman's daily life has previously been in accord with such\nsimple rules of health as everyone should adopt, the existence of\npregnancy calls for very slight changes.\n\nIt does not, for example, condemn her to inactivity and seclusion,\nfor it is advisable to lead a moderately active life during\npregnancy. Of course, such obvious indiscretions as prolonged\nexertion, violent exercise, and fatiguing journeys should be avoided,\nfor transgression of the laws of health brings its own punishment,\ngenerally in the form of discomfort, more quickly, and often more\nseverely, during pregnancy than at other times. Yet, on the whole, it\nis more frequently necessary to emphasize to prospective mothers what\nthey should do than what they should avoid. This happens to be the\ncase because, as a rule, they are inclined to become recluses. For\nfear of attracting attention they often wish to give up outdoor\nexercise during the day; they stay away from public places of\namusement, and deny themselves other pleasures to which they have\nbeen accustomed. Against this tendency they must be warned, for if\nthey yield to it they will surely be the worse off both physically\nand mentally. Every prospective mother should make up her mind to\nenjoy recreation out of doors regardless of comments.\n\nTHE NEED OF PURE AIR.--Outdoor life has been so urgently advocated of\nlate that the public has come to appreciate its benefits almost as\nfully as do physicians. The existence of pregnancy does not lessen,\nbut rather enhances, the value of fresh air; in order to enjoy the\nbest health during this period one should spend at least two hours\nout of doors every day. Neither the season of the year nor the state\nof weather should modify this obligation. If the sun is shining the\n\"airing\" is more delightful, but it should be taken in bad weather\nalso, on a protected porch or in a room with the windows wide open.\n\nEven when the injunction to be regularly out of doors is observed\nwomen are accustomed to spend the greater portion of the day in the\nhouse, and on that account special attention must be given to keeping\nthe air of the house pure. Ventilation takes care of itself in\nsummer, when the windows are open, but in cold weather, when in our\nanxiety to keep the temperature comfortable we may overlook the need\nof fresh air, it demands close attention. The necessity of\nventilation at all times is due, of course, to the composition of the\natmosphere and to the changes produced in it as we breathe.\n\nThe air about us is a mixture of gases, of which oxygen and nitrogen\nare the most important. Although nitrogen, which constitutes four-\nfifths of the atmosphere, is taken into our lungs in breathing, we\nmake no use of it, but breathe it out in precisely the same condition\nas we take it in. As chemically combined in the food-stuff known as\nprotein, nitrogen is indispensable to animal life; but our bodies\nmake no use of the gaseous form of nitrogen. Oxygen, on the other\nhand, supports life; and though it forms less than one-fifth of the\natmospheric air, it is present in ample amount for our needs. After\nwe draw air into our lungs, the oxygen it contains is absorbed by the\nblood and used by the tissues. In return our tissues give up a waste\nproduct, carbonic acid gas, which is thrown off by the lungs. It is\ninteresting to observe that the carbonic acid gas which animals\nexhale supports the life of plants, and that the plants, under the\ninfluence of sunlight, give back pure oxygen to the atmosphere.\nObviously, the complementary relation exhibited here is of mutual\nbenefit.\n\nThe average person uses about four bushels of air a minute.\nConsequently, rooms that are occupied must be constantly replenished\nwith fresh air; otherwise the point is quickly reached where the\noccupants are breathing an atmosphere that is not only poor in oxygen\nbut saturated with carbonic acid gas and other impurities conveyed by\nthe breath. Foul air such as this causes headache, dizziness,\nfaintness, nausea, and occasionally even more serious disturbances.\nThose who live in \"close\" rooms day after day grow pale and languid;\ntheir appetite fails and some of their natural power of resistance\nagainst illness is lost. Many people are unhealthy simply because\nthey neglect to supply their living quarters with a steady stream of\nair from the outside.\n\nWhile it is impossible to keep the air in any room as pure as the\noutside atmosphere, perfectly satisfactory ventilation can be easily\narranged. Some of the impure air in a house is always escaping of its\nown accord and its place is taken by air from the outside. Thus, the\ncracks around the windows and doors let bad air out and good air in;\nand, besides, most building materials are porous. These natural\npaths, however, must be supplemented. The simplest device for\nventilation, which is also the best, consists in opening a window at\nthe top and bottom. The width of the opening may be regulated so as\nto permit the air in the room to change without occasioning\ndisagreeable drafts; if necessary the current may be broken by a\nscreen of some pervious material placed in the opening.\n\nThe bed-room should always be supplied with plenty, of fresh air,\nwhich \"quiets the nerves\" and helps one to sleep soundly.\nFurthermore, the temperature of the bed-room should be lower than the\ntemperature of rooms occupied during the day. Both these requisites\nwill be properly met by leaving a window open at night, which may be\ndone throughout the year in most climates, if one puts on enough\ncovering. There is no danger of catching cold from sleeping with the\nwindow open; on the contrary, breathing fresh air day and night is\none of the best ways to prevent colds.\n\nOUTDOOR EXERCISE.--Outdoor exercise is indispensable to good health.\nIt benefits not only the muscles, but the whole body. By this means\nthe action of the heart is strengthened, and consequently all the\ntissues receive a rich supply of oxygen. Exercise also promotes the\ndigestion and the assimilation of the food. It stimulates the sweat\nglands to become more active; and, for that matter, the other\nexcretory organs as well. It invigorates the muscles, strengthens the\nnerves, and clears the brain. There is, indeed, no part of the human\nmachine that does not run more smoothly if its owner exercises\nsystematically in the open air; and during normal pregnancy there is\nno exception to this rule. Only in extremely rare cases--those,\nnamely, in which extraordinary precautions must be taken to prevent\nmiscarriage--will physicians prohibit outdoor recreation and,\nperhaps, every other kind of exertion. Under such circumstances the\ngood effects that most persons secure from exercise should be sought\nfrom the use of massage.\n\nThe amount of exercise which the prospective mother should take\ncannot be stated precisely, but what can be definitely said is this--\nshe should stop the moment she begins to feel tired. Fatigue is only\none step short of exhaustion--and, since exhaustion must always be\ncarefully guarded against, the safest rule will be to leave off\nexercising at a point where one still feels capable of doing more\nwithout becoming tired. Women who have laborious household duties to\nperform do not require as much exercise as those who lead sedentary\nlives; but they do require just as much fresh air, and should make it\na rule to sit quietly out of doors two or three hours every day. It\nwill be found, furthermore, that the limit of endurance is reached\nmore quickly toward the end of pregnancy than at the beginning; a few\npatients will find it necessary to stop exercise altogether for a\nweek or two before they are delivered.\n\nWalking is the best kind of exercise, but long tramps are inadvisable\nduring pregnancy, except for those who have previously been\naccustomed to them. Most women who are pregnant find that a two or\nthree-mile walk daily is all they enjoy, and very few are inclined to\nindulge in six miles, which is generally accepted as the upper limit.\nPerhaps the best way to measure a walk is by the length of time it\nconsumes. Accordingly, a very sensible plan is to begin with a walk\njust long enough not to be fatiguing and to increase it by five\nminutes each day until able to walk an hour without becoming\novertired. It is always advisable not to crowd the exercise of a day\ninto a single period but rather to take it in several installments,\nfor example, an hour in the morning, and another in the afternoon.\nUnder all circumstances, it must never be forgotten that the feeling\nof fatigue is a peremptory signal to stop, no matter how short the\nwalk has been.\n\nVery few outdoor sports can be unconditionally recommended to a\nprospective mother. Because athletic exercise is either too violent\nor else jolts or jars the body a great deal, it is especially\ndangerous in the early months of pregnancy--the only time when it is\nlikely to be at all attractive. Croquet, alone, perhaps, is free from\nthese objections. Although golf and tennis are by no means certain to\nbring on miscarriage, they involve a risk which, slight though it may\nperhaps be, will not be assumed by cautious women.\n\nHorseback riding during pregnancy is injurious. We occasionally hear\nof women who have ridden horseback without immediate harmful\nconsequences, but they have nevertheless exposed themselves to danger\nunnecessarily. It is better to give up skating and dancing also than\nto run the risk of accident, especially since these diversions are\nattended with some danger of falling. In a general way, whenever the\nquestion of entering into any kind of recreation must be decided, it\nis wise to err on the conservative side rather than risk overstepping\nthe limit of endurance and having to pay a penalty more or less\nsevere.\n\nCarriage riding cannot take the place of walking and can scarcely be\nclassed as exercise; it is wholesome, nevertheless, because it takes\nthe participant out of doors and provides a change of scene. Certain\ndetails, however, should be carefully observed; thus, a safe horse, a\ncarriage that rides easily, and smooth roads should be selected.\nSimilar advice pertains to motoring; with smooth roads, a cautious\ndriver, and a comfortable machine, short rides in an automobile are\nnot harmful. Carriage riding and motoring are particularly\nserviceable as a means of getting outdoor diversion during the last\nfew weeks of pregnancy.\n\nMASSAGE AND GYMNASTICS.--If a prospective mother is obliged to stay\nin bed several weeks, massage may be useful; otherwise there is no\nnecessity for this treatment. Whenever required, massage should if\npossible be given by an experienced masseuse. If this is out of the\nquestion and the patient must rely upon one of her friends, it should\nbe understood that \"general massage\" is needed; in other words, one\npart of the body after another should be gone over systematically.\nWith an inexperienced masseuse, however, it will be safer not to\nmassage the abdomen, since awkward, vigorous, or prolonged\nmanipulations in that locality may provoke painful uterine\ncontractions. Rubbing the breasts also can do no good; on the\ncontrary, it may do harm by bruising them.\n\nThe best time of day to have massage is in the morning, at least an\nhour after breakfast. The duration of the treatment will depend upon\nthe patient; it should always cease as soon as she begins to feel\ntired. After one has become accustomed to it, massage may generally\nbe continued for an hour. The room in which it is given should be\ncool, and after the treatment has been completed the patient should\nbe wrapped warmly and left undisturbed for half an hour.\n\nGymnastics, like massage, are useless to those who can enjoy outdoor\nexercise. Walking more perfectly strengthens the muscles which take\npart in the act of birth than any system of \"home calisthenics\" that\nhas been suggested. In some conditions which make walking inadvisable\nthe use of calisthenics will be helpful. These exercises generally\nconsist in breathing movements and in movements of the extremities,\nespecially the legs, which bring into play the same abdominal muscles\nthat are used at the time of delivery. A detailed description of the\nexercises is here purposely omitted, since gymnastics should not be\nused unless advised by a physician, who should watch their effect and\nthus be guided as to whether the patient should continue them.\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF WORK UPON PREGNANCY.--No single influence is more\nunfavorable to comfort and health during pregnancy than is idleness,\nso that every prospective should occupy herself with congenial work\nand fitting diversions. The kind of occupation makes no essential\ndifference, so long as it does not overtire either the body or the\nmind. Since most women are absorbed in the affairs of the home, it\nmay be well to begin by saying that the existence of pregnancy by no\nmeans requires the abandonment of domestic duties. On the contrary,\nwhen it is convenient, the prospective mother should have a share in\nthe housework. She should not undertake everything that is to be done\nabout the house, for no matter how small the household there are\ncertain duties too laborious for her to attempt; these will be easily\nrecognized and turned over to someone else. Even with regard to those\ntasks which lie within her strength she should use a little\nforethought to prevent unnecessary steps.\n\nAll kinds of violent exertion should be avoided--a rule which at once\nexcludes sweeping, scrubbing, laundry work, lifting anything that is\nheavy, and going up and down stairs hurriedly or frequently. The use\nof a sewing machine is also emphatically forbidden. Treadle work is\nknown to be one cause of swollen feet, of varicose veins, and of\naches and pains in the legs or the abdomen. If a prospective mother\nhas to do her own sewing, the machine should be fitted with a hand\nattachment or motor. Except for the possibility of straining the\neyes, there is no objection to sewing by hand.\n\nBesides the activities that should be excluded because they may be\nharmful, every housekeeper will find enough to keep her busy. It is\ngenerally not a small task to suggest what others shall do and to see\nthat orders are properly carried out; consequently those who take no\npart in the actual work may retain an absorbing interest in their\ndomestic affairs by directing them. Such direction, indeed, should,\ntoward the end of pregnancy, constitute the mother's sole\nparticipation in the housework.\n\nIn a general way the amount and the kind of work that a woman may be\npermitted to undertake during pregnancy depend upon what she has been\nused to. It is not unlikely that anyone who is unaccustomed to manual\nlabor may injure her health and cause the pregnancy to end\nprematurely if she undertakes hard work. On the other hand, women of\nthe working classes sometimes continue at their occupations to the\nnatural end of pregnancy without harmful consequences. It is\nundeniable, however, that among this class miscarriages are more\nfrequent than among the well-to-do. Furthermore, the average birth-\nweight of mature infants whose mothers have remained at work during\nthe last three months of pregnancy is ten per cent. less than the\naverage birth-weight of infants among the leisure class. This matter\nof the baby's weight is not always serious in itself, but indicates\nin the case of working women who are pregnant the existence of a\nstrain that sometimes leads to serious accidents.\n\nThe employment of women during pregnancy and immediately thereafter\nis regulated by law in many countries. For example, the laws of\nHolland, Belgium, England, Portugal, and Austria prohibit the\nemployment of women in factories during the last four weeks of\npregnancy or the four weeks following childbirth. Such employment is\nunlawful in Switzerland for two weeks before and six weeks after\nchildbirth. There is no legal regulation of the employment of\npregnant women in either Germany or Norway, but the laws of both\ncountries forbid them to return to work until six weeks after they\nhave been delivered. Among civilized nations Turkey, Russia, Spain,\nItaly, France, and the United States make no attempt to regulate\nemployment either before or after childbirth.\n\nOf course there are strong sentimental reasons for relieving\nprospective mothers of the necessity of earning a living, but there\nare also excellent hygienic reasons against many kinds of employment.\nFor example, it should be unlawful to employ them in chemical\nindustries where, owing to their condition, they are especially\nliable to be injured by the materials which they handle. Jacobi\nstates that the worst occupation for pregnant women is working with\nmetals, in particular lead; more than half of them suffer miscarriage\nor premature confinement. Furthermore, the health of the child may be\nendangered if the prospective mother does hard work of any kind. This\nis true chiefly because she does not have appropriate intervals of\nrelaxation, for it is a firmly established principle that a\nprospective mother must be free to rest the moment she begins to feel\ntired. The least, therefore, that can be done to better prevalent\nconditions among women who must work during pregnancy is to require\nby law a reduction in the number of their working hours, and to\nprotect them from the necessity of earning a living for two months\nafter they have been delivered.\n\nRELAXATION AND REST.--During the early months of pregnancy many women\ncomplain that they feel enervated, and tire quickly even when they do\nthings which were formerly done with ease; this experience is so\ncommon that it can scarcely be considered other than natural.\nCuriously enough this is also the period during which the attachment\nof the ovum to the womb is relatively insecure, and therefore the\ninclination to be quiet is justified by the prevailing anatomical\nconditions. No prospective mother should struggle against the\ninclination to rest; she should yield to it in spite of the advice to\nthe contrary which older women are apt to give. Furthermore, it is\nespecially important about the time when a menstrual period would\nordinarily be expected to be guided by this impulse not to be active,\nsince overexertion then, more than at other times, is apt to be\nfollowed by miscarriage. Except in rare cases the observance of this\nprecaution is less urgent after the fourth month, when the ovum has\nbecome more securely attached to the womb. But again, toward the end\nof pregnancy the development of the mother's body necessitates a\ncomparatively large amount of rest; patients who continue to exert\nthemselves may expect to suffer from shortness of breath and a number\nof other annoyances.\n\nIn order to save needless steps and to avoid confusion and worry, it\nis always helpful to map out beforehand what must be done in the\ncourse of the day. Ideally, such a schedule should set apart\nintervals for relaxation and rest. In the morning, for example, while\nthe housework is in progress, it is important to stop occasionally,\nif only for a few moments, and lie down on a couch. After the midday\nmeal it is advisable to undress and go to bed. Even though one does\nnot fall asleep, an hour or two of complete relaxation will be\nbeneficial. A nap in the afternoon does not interfere with sleeping\nat night provided plenty of exercise has been taken during the day.\nIn this way walking in the late afternoon or early evening helps to\nsecure a good night's rest.\n\nDuring the first six or seven months, pregnancy, in itself, does not\ncause sleeplessness, but later, as a natural result of the\nenlargement of the womb, there are several disagreeable symptoms\nwhich may cause broken rest at night. In the later months the weight\nof the womb requires women to sleep on the side, and for some of them\nthis position is awkward at first. Frequently the pressure makes it\nnecessary to get up several times during the night to empty the\nbladder. In a few cases also the compression of the chest interferes\nsomewhat with breathing. When insomnia is due to the pressure of the\nwomb against neighboring parts of the body, it can be partially\ncounteracted by getting into a comfortable position; but it is also\nnecessary to have the surroundings as conducive to sleep as possible.\nThus anyone will be much more likely to rest well if the bed-room is\nlarge and well ventilated, if the mattress is comfortable, and if the\ncoverings are warm without being heavy. Finally, not the least\nimportant detail is to occupy a single bed, so that it is possible to\nturn over without fear of disturbing someone else.\n\nIn most instances, however, the inability to sleep during pregnancy--\nand indeed at any time--is due to a faulty frame of mind. With\nreference to the average man or woman, in his very helpful book \"Why\nWorry,\" Walton says, \"it is futile to expect that a fretful,\nimpatient, and overanxious frame of mind, continuing through the day\nand every day, will be suddenly replaced at night by the placid and\ncomfortable mental state which shall insure a restful sleep.\" Like\neveryone else, the prospective mother must stop thinking when she\nretires, otherwise the blood will not be diverted from the brain as\nit must be to fall asleep. To aid in bringing about this condition a\nnumber of expedients may be employed. For example, a warm bath, warm\nsheets, or a hot-water bottle placed against the feet all help to\ndraw the blood from the brain to other parts of the body. Similarly,\na warm glass of milk or a small portion of easily digestible solid\nfood taken just before retiring will help to make one drowsy; on the\nother hand, over-eating at the evening meal or later is not an\ninfrequent cause of wakefulness.\n\nThe use of narcotics is rarely necessary in the early months of\npregnancy, and the simple measures just mentioned will also generally\nbe found sufficient in the later months. But these procedures, or any\nother except the use of strong drugs, will be ineffective unless the\nindividual knows how to get into the proper state of mind. This means\nnot only that she must be able to banish worries, regrets, and\nforebodings; she must also have acquired confidence in whatever\nmethod she employs. She must convince herself that she can sleep, or\nat least that _it makes no difference if she cannot_. This\nindependent spirit, which is very essential, can be confidently\nassumed, for if she does not sleep well it can be made up during the\nnext day or at least the next night. Having adopted this attitude,\nand having assumed a comfortable position, which should be retained\nas long as possible, the attention should be concentrated upon the\nthought, \"I am getting sleepy, I am going to sleep.\" Under these\ncircumstances she can hypnotize herself and \"produce the desired\nresult more often than by watching the proverbial sheep follow one\nanother over the wall.\"\n\nIS TRAVELING HARMFUL?--Traveling has been made so easy and alluring\nthat nowadays long journeys are undertaken with scarcely more concern\nthan was once felt when the people of neighboring towns exchanged\nvisits. Thus modern facilities have introduced a new factor into the\nproblem of the way to live during pregnancy. It is a well-known fact\nthat traveling is sometimes attended with risk to the prospective\nmother, though the danger is exaggerated in the popular estimation.\nFor this the newspapers are chiefly to blame. They inform the public\nof the cases in which embarrassing situations have arisen, but there\nis no record of the thousands of pregnant women who travel without\nany mishap.\n\nWhat the effect of traveling is likely to be is very difficult to\npredict under any circumstances, and the question cannot be answered\nat all unless the specific conditions presented by each case are\ntaken into account. In a general way the points to be considered are\nthe vigor of the patient, the period of pregnancy at which she has\narrived, and the character of the journey she wishes to undertake.\nPrudent women will never attempt to decide this question for\nthemselves, but will always obtain professional advice. The\ndisapproval of the physician, no doubt, will sometimes cause keen\ndisappointment; but conservative advice is the best and should always\nbe followed.\n\nTo be on the safe side a prospective mother who has previously had a\nmiscarriage should not travel at any time during pregnancy; others\nare not obliged to follow this stringent rule except during the first\nsixteen and the last four weeks of pregnancy. In the former period\nthere is some danger of miscarriage because traveling may cause\nseparation of the relatively loose attachment of the ovum. In the\nlatter period the muscle-fibers of the womb are usually irritable and\ntherefore the rolling of a ship or the jolting of a car may set up\npainful contractions which in some instances expel the fetus.\nGenerally there is the least risk of accident between the eighteenth\nand the thirty-second weeks, though patients should be careful even\nduring this interval not to travel at the time when a menstrual\nperiod would ordinarily be expected.\n\nThe length of the journey and the ease with which it can be made are\nalso important features to be considered. Obviously there will be\nless danger of mishap from a short trip than from a long one; if\npossible, therefore, long journeys by rail should be broken so as to\nafford opportunity for rest. Railroad trips which do not exceed two\nor three hours are generally not so fatiguing that they must be\nprohibited, provided the individual is perfectly well. Traveling by\nboat is less tiresome than traveling by rail and, if equally\nconvenient, the boat should be given the preference. Long automobile\ntours are attended with considerable risk of miscarriage and,\ntherefore, are forbidden.\n\nMENTAL DIVERSION.--As a rule good health prevails throughout\npregnancy; it would be enjoyed even more frequently if many\nprospective mothers did not think so much about the fact that they\nare pregnant. For this deplorable self-consciousness the spirit of\nthe age is in part to blame; there never was a time, in all\nprobability, when people took such a keen interest in all matters\npertaining to health. It is also true, however, that fuller\ninstruction is needed now because the temptations to depart from a\nregular, temperate way of living have notably increased.\n\nAt all events the point has now been reached where the average man or\nwoman knows something of anatomy, physiology, and the laws of\nhygiene. Such knowledge should be helpful, and generally is, but if\nit causes anyone to think incessantly about the workings of the body,\nto that person it is detrimental. We all know such individuals. They\nare made miserable because they scrutinize functions, like the\nbeating of the heart, that go on automatically and should be left\nunobserved, or they minutely analyze their feelings and misinterpret\nnormal sensations as the evidence of disease.\n\nThe tendency to be introspective is especially pronounced in women\nwho are pregnant, and this is readily explained by the reciprocal\nrelations between the mind and the body. If the prospective mother\ncorrectly interpreted the changes which occur in her body, as well as\nthe sensations for which these changes are responsible, she would\nescape the uneasiness of mind that causes many sorts of discomfort.\nIt is unfortunately true, however, that her lack of familiarity with\nthe facts about pregnancy and her belief in unfounded traditions\nfrequently lead to the misinterpretation of natural conditions. An\nanxious frame of mind also causes real ailments to assume an\nimportance out of all proportion to their actual significance.\n\nPatients who have followed my advice to place themselves in the care\nof a physician as soon as they clearly recognize the existence of\npregnancy will receive his assistance in properly estimating the\nsignificance of what they notice. This service is by no means the\nleast the obstetrician renders his patients. His opinion should\nalways be sought when symptoms are not understood; but it is not\nunusual for patients to bring to the doctor's attention many\ncomplaints that would pass unnoticed if they taught themselves to\nrestrain the imagination, to refrain from pessimistic reflections,\nand to divert their thoughts from themselves to outside affairs.\n\nGenerally it is during the early months of pregnancy that patients\nare most likely to be self-centered, and consequently suffer from\nmany annoyances that either proceed from or are exaggerated by this\nfaulty frame of mind. During this period a prospective mother is not\nfully aware of the meaning of pregnancy. Toward the twentieth week,\nhowever, she perceives the movements of the child and her thoughts\nare turned to it instinctively. About this time many of the\ndiscomforts of pregnancy disappear and there ensues a period of\nunusually good health. Perhaps it would be going too far to give this\nmore wholesome altruistic mental attitude the entire credit for the\nrelatively better health of the second half of pregnancy, but without\ndoubt it is a most important factor.\n\nSuch then is the influence of the mind over the body that anyone who\nwishes to cultivate good health must correct the faulty habit of\nalways thinking of herself. The most suitable form of diversion will\ndepend upon personal taste. Domestic duties absorb the attention of\nmost prospective mothers, but domestic duties should not occupy them\nexclusively. Outdoor recreation is necessary and serves the double\npurpose of strengthening mind and body. Public amusements should also\nbe patronized; no prospective mother has the right to sacrifice\nherself to pride. Music, the various arts, a systematic course of\nreading, the acquisition of a foreign language--all these are\ncommendable forms of diversion, and others will occur to anyone.\nObviously the avocation will be most happily chosen if it directs the\nattention into channels likely to lead to the greatest pleasure.",

        "content": "THE AILMENTS OF PREGNANCY\n\nNausea and Vomiting--Heartburn--Flatulence--Defective Teeth--Pressure\nSymptoms: Swelling of the Feet; Varicose Veins; Hemorrhoids;\nShortness of Breath--Leucorrhea--Toxemias.\n\n\nMost of the ailments to which prospective mothers are liable are\nmerely the natural manifestations of pregnancy, exaggerated to such\nan extent as to cause inconvenience and discomfort. In the early\nmonths, for example, persistent nausea and vomiting may become the\nsource of great annoyance, and later the pressure of the womb against\nneighboring structures may cause a variety of symptoms. It does not\nfollow, however, that any of these ailments will necessarily appear.\nOn the contrary, many women are more healthy during pregnancy than at\nany other time.\n\nOccasionally illness is charged to pregnancy with which in reality\npregnancy has nothing to do. While awaiting the birth of a child,\njust as at other times, women may suffer from coughs or colds, from\naches or pains, from malaria, pneumonia, typhoid fever, or in fact\nfrom any disease. It is evident that such complications are\naccidental; and, though pregnancy confers no immunity against them,\nit does not, on the other hand, render women more susceptible to all\nkinds of ailment.\n\nAnd yet there are diseases for which pregnancy is directly\nresponsible. These are, to a very large extent, preventable; and,\nthough they occur rarely, precautions for their prevention should be\ntaken in every case of pregnancy. By far the most important members\nof this group are the toxemias of pregnancy. These, as will be\nexplained later, cause symptoms which the patient herself may\nrecognize, and her physician may often detect their presence still\nearlier by alterations in the composition of the urine. For this\nreason routine examination of the urine during pregnancy is a means\nof prevention indispensable for safeguarding the health of the\nprospective mother.\n\nA number of ailments of which prospective mothers may complain do not\nrequire treatment with medicine. This, however, will not be taken to\nimply that there is no need to consult a physician. On the contrary,\nand it cannot be emphasized too strongly, the prospective mother\nshould _seek professional service whenever there is anything about\nher condition she does not understand_. Sometimes, when she thus\nconsults the physician, he will explain to her that what she has\nnoticed is merely one of the natural manifestations of pregnancy and\nthat she can have no control over it; at other times he will suggest\nchanges in her mode of life which will very likely afford her relief.\nThe frequency with which physicians find that ailments may be\ncorrected by the adoption of hygienic measures indicates that such\nailments are more often due to ignorance or carelessness than to the\nexistence of disease.\n\nNAUSEA AND VOMITING.--We have already learned that nausea, especially\nin the morning on rising from bed, frequently corroborates the\nsuspicion of a woman that she has become pregnant. So commonly,\nindeed, is this symptom expected that most women take no account of\nit other than as an evidence that they have conceived, and\nconsequently do not complain of it. A few who have heard the old\nadage, \"a sick pregnancy means a safe one,\" which incidentally is not\ncorrect, actually accept nausea as a favorable sign. In other cases\nthe nausea is not to be dismissed so lightly; and a relatively small\ngroup of patients suffer from persistent vomiting. When prospective\nmothers are questioned systematically, it appears that at least one-\nhalf and perhaps two-thirds of them experience more or less\ndiscomfort from sick stomach. Generally this begins shortly after a\nmenstrual period has been missed and ceases six or eight weeks later;\nit persists occasionally until the movements of the child have been\nperceived.\n\nNausea and vomiting are limited, in the vast majority of cases, to\nthe early morning, but some patients are annoyed only after meals,\nand a few at irregular intervals during the day. The fact that the\nattacks do not always appear at the same time, and that they differ\nin severity, indicates that different causes may be concerned in\ntheir production. And it is true that there are several kinds of\nvomiting that occur during pregnancy, although the classification\ninterests only physicians. The laity, however, should understand that\nthe treatment of any given case will vary according to the class to\nwhich it belongs, and therefore the occurrence of troublesome\nvomiting should be promptly reported to the physician.\n\nMost frequently it will be found that there is nothing serious the\nmatter. The vomiting ceases or, at least, it becomes less troublesome\nas soon as the diet has been more carefully arranged, constipation\nhas been corrected, or other hygienic details, such as outdoor\nrecreation and mental diversion, have received the attention\nrequisite for good health. In a much smaller group of cases the\nrestoration of the womb to a proper position or the treatment of some\nother local condition, which can generally be remedied without\ndifficulty, is all that is necessary. But finally, in extremely rare\ninstances, the vomiting of pregnancy is due to a definite disease\nwhose existence may be recognized by special methods of analyzing the\nurine. In any case, if the physician is given an opportunity to make\nthe necessary observations and thus determine the variety of the\nvomiting, no time will be lost in beginning effective treatment. In\nan overwhelming majority of the cases, as I have said, nothing\nserious will be found; and then the control of the vomiting will lie\nwithin the power of the patient herself.\n\nSince nausea is usually experienced in the morning on rising from the\nrecumbent to the upright posture, measures to prevent an attack\nshould be begun even before the patient raises her head from the\npillow. In the first place something to eat should be taken as soon\nas she awakens. The most satisfactory results follow eating two or\nthree pieces of crisp toast or a Bent's cracker (sold by grocers),\neither of which should be thoroughly chewed and swallowed without\ntaking anything to drink. Good results are also obtained, though less\nuniformly, from eating other food, such as fruit, oatmeal, or eggs.\nThe benefit secured from this procedure is explained, perhaps, by the\nactivity of the digestive organs and the effect of that activity upon\nthe circulation of the blood. The food eaten before rising is not\nintended to take the place of breakfast, which ordinarily will be\neaten later. Furthermore, it is essential to remain in bed until half\nan hour after the food was taken; and not to rise then unless\nperfectly comfortable. Anyone who is inclined to be nauseated should\nget up slowly and dress leisurely, sitting down as much as possible\nwhile putting on the clothes. If breakfast is not desired at once, it\nshould not be forced, but some food should be eaten between early\nmorning and noon.\n\nIt is an exceedingly good rule to bend every effort toward escaping\nthe initial attack of nausea, for in this way one soon gains\nconfidence, and overcomes the depressing habit of being continually\non the watch for the symptom, lest she be taken unawares.\nExceptionally, however, patients feel more comfortable if they vomit\nin the morning; this may be helpful, for example, if a large meal has\nbeen eaten just before retiring the previous night.\n\nNext to morning sickness in point of frequency comes the disposition\nto be nauseated about meal time. Those who vomit after the meal is\nfinished are frequently inclined to eat soon again; and there is no\nreason why they should not. Sick stomach after meals may be due to\nseveral causes, such as eating hurriedly, eating too much, or\nselecting food that is difficult to digest. If a meal is bolted the\nstomach may be overloaded before the appetite is appeased; and\nconsequently those who eat too much are fortunate when the stomach\nrejects the excess. Eating slowly and masticating the food\nthoroughly, we know, is the proper way to insure taking no more than\nis needed.\n\nOne of the most valuable precautions against persistent nausea\nconsists in taking small amounts of food five or six times during the\nday. Directions regarding the frequency of meals and the choice of\nfood have been given in Chapter IV, to which the reader may refer. It\nmay be repeated, however, that a prospective mother should naturally\navoid anything which she knows is likely not to agree with her. On\nthe other hand, she is almost certain not to be nauseated by any\narticle of food for which she has an appetite.\n\nLying down for a short while after meals frequently serves to prevent\nan attack of vomiting. It is a good rule, furthermore, at whatever\ntime of day the sensation of nausea may occur, to lie down\nimmediately. An ice bag or cloths wrung out of cold water, if applied\nto the abdomen, often give relief; warm applications occasionally\nserve the same purpose better. Some patients prevent nausea by\nconstantly wearing a flannel bandage about the abdomen.\n\nMany instances of the vomiting of pregnancy cannot be explained by\nerrors in diet, for the attacks come on repeatedly whether the\nstomach contains food or not. Under these circumstances mental\ninfluences frequently have to be reckoned with. Indeed, in most cases\nof vomiting of pregnancy dietetic and other hygienic measures are of\nno avail unless the patient learns to divert her attention from\ntroublesome thoughts.\n\nThat the brain can exert an influence over the stomach is a fact well\nsubstantiated both by physiological experiment and by medical\nobservation. In all probability there is a definite spot in the\nbrain, called the \"vomiting center,\" the irritation of which causes\nretching and the upheaval of the contents of the stomach. As this\nnervous mechanism is possessed by everyone, it is not called into\nexistence by the advent of pregnancy. Nevertheless, it seems likely\nthat pregnancy renders it more sensitive, and it is certain that\npregnancy establishes new means by which the center may be\nstimulated. This admission does not imply, however, that the\nprospective mother must submit to inevitable discomfort, for she can\nand should muster the strength to resist it.\n\nTime and again an unhappy frame of mind exaggerates or prolongs the\nvomiting of pregnancy. Thus, disappointment, anxiety, grief, fright,\nand other types of mental uneasiness not only magnify the discomfort\nbut sometimes are its sole cause. The curious cases in which the\nhusband suffers from nausea while his wife is pregnant are explained\nby mental influences. As a result of the same kind of influence,\nwomen who imagine themselves to be pregnant often suffer from violent\nvomiting, which ceases as soon as they discover their error. On the\nother hand, women who for several months remain ignorant of the fact\nthat they are pregnant rarely suffer from sick stomach.\n\nAny kind of worry may be and often is the direct cause of the\nvomiting of pregnancy, though patients are often unwilling to confess\nit; and occasionally do not seem to know what it is that troubles\nthem. In any event, having received the assurance of her physician\nthat there is nothing serious the matter, the prospective mother who\nis annoyed by nausea should make every effort not to become self-\ncentered. She should have congenial companionship and should interest\nherself in pursuits outside of, as well as within, her home. Of all\nthe measures that may be employed to overcome this manifestation of\npregnancy the most fundamental and essential is mental diversion.\n\nHEARTBURN.--Obviously, it would not be fair to consider indigestion\nas one of the ailments peculiar to pregnancy, for anyone is liable to\nsuffer from indigestion. Yet dyspeptic symptoms, more especially\nheartburn and flatulence, occur so frequently at this time that\nsomething should be said regarding their causation and treatment.\n\nA burning sensation rising from the stomach into the throat,\nfamiliarly called heartburn, is generally due to an overabundant\nsecretion of hydrochloric acid, which is, as we have learned, a\nnormal constituent of the gastric juice. Of late, the conditions\nwhich influence its secretion have been the subject of laboratory\ninvestigation, which has disclosed, among other interesting facts,\nthe way to _prevent_ heartburn. These experiments have taught\nthat the introduction of fat into the stomach shortly before a meal\ndecreases the amount of acid secreted during digestion. Consequently,\nanyone who is troubled by heartburn and wishes to avoid it _should\ntake a tablespoonful of olive oil, a cup of cream, or a glass of rich\nmilk fifteen or twenty minutes before meal-time_.\n\nOn the other hand, fatty food eaten with the meals prolongs the stay\nof food in the stomach and causes an increase in the secretion of\nhydrochloric acid. An excess of the acid, as we have just learned, is\nfavorable to the development of heartburn. Therefore, as a further\nprecaution against this source of discomfort, it is advisable not to\nuse a large amount of butter or of salad oil, and to refrain from\nfried food, rich desserts, or any other article of diet known to\ncontain a relatively large amount of fat.\n\nOnce it has developed, heartburn will be aggravated by taking cream\nor olive oil. The most rational _curative measures_ then consist\nin diluting the acid by drinking a couple of glasses of water and in\ncounteracting (neutralizing) the acid by taking a teaspoonful of\nbaking soda (bicarbonate of soda) or a tablespoonful of limewater;\nand, if necessary, either of these doses may be repeated. Patients\noften adopt the very sensible habit of carrying with them a block of\nmagnesium carbonate, which they nibble whenever the symptom appears.\n\nFLATULENCE.--The distention of stomach and intestines with gas,\ntechnically called flatulence, may be associated with heartburn or\nappear independently. The gas arises from the action of bacteria upon\nthe food. There can be little doubt that flatulence occurs so\nregularly during pregnancy because the pressure of the enlarged womb\nprevents the contents of the intestine from moving along as rapidly\nas they have done previously.\n\nTo be relieved from this source of discomfort, it is necessary, in\nthe first place, that the bowels should be regularly evacuated; very\noften nothing further is required than to overcome the habit of\nconstipation. Occasionally, however, the diet must be arranged so as\nto exclude food which is likely to form gas. For example, parsnips,\nbeans, corn, fried food, candy, cake, and sweet desserts, all of\nwhich are known to cause flatulence, should be avoided; in aggravated\ncases the allowance of starchy food of every kind should be cut down\nto small portions.\n\nSince the production of gas in the intestine is due to the action of\nbacteria sometimes relief from flatulence is secured only after the\nadministration of intestinal antiseptics. Drugs, however, will be\nprescribed by the physician, and will not be employed until the\nsimpler hygienic measures have failed. Similarly, the physician\nshould decide whether it is advisable for the patient to drink milk\ninoculated with harmless bacteria (The Bulgarian Bacillus) which has\nlately been placed on the market. The bacteria thus administered in\nthe milk are antagonistic to the intestinal bacteria that produce\ngas, and consequently have been recommended for the treatment of\nflatulence. If this commercial product cannot be conveniently\nobtained, one may use instead tablets containing the bacteria, which\ncan be supplied by druggists.\n\nDEFECTIVE TEETH.--Unless suitable precautions are observed, the\ndigestive disturbances of pregnancy have a tendency to injure the\nteeth. The regurgitation of the acid contents of the stomach, for\nexample, may cause cavities to develop or may enlarge those that\nalready exist. In all probability the damage done in this way--and\nnot the removal of lime from the teeth for the formation of the\nchild's skeleton, as some have thought--is responsible for the origin\nof the saying that \"every child costs a tooth.\" This notion is of\ncourse absurd, yet it is quite true that toothache and the decay or\nloosening of the teeth are not infrequently associated with\npregnancy. On this account, throughout the period of pregnancy\nparticular care should be given the teeth.\n\nOne of the very first duties of a prospective mother, after she knows\nthat conception has taken place, is to visit her dentist. This step\nis very important as a means of insuring the teeth against such\nharmful influence as pregnancy may have upon them. If the dentist\nfinds the teeth in poor condition, the patient should consent to have\nthem treated immediately. That this is the reasonable course seems\nsufficiently obvious, yet the majority of women have been slow to\nadopt such a view.\n\nFor a long time dental work of every description was incorrectly\nbelieved to have an untoward effect upon the development of the\nchild; and the extraction of a tooth, it was thought, would surely be\nfollowed by miscarriage. Although the extraction of teeth is not\nfrequently undertaken nowadays, I have known several prospective\nmothers who required the operation, and who had it performed without\nexperiencing a single untoward symptom. Very naturally dental work\nshould be restricted during pregnancy to that which is absolutely\nnecessary, and temporary fillings generally suffice; but whatever is\nneeded should be done without delay.\n\nBrushing the teeth after meals and removing particles of food that\nmay have been caught between them--important enough at all times--are\nof even greater importance during pregnancy. If the gums are sore and\nthe teeth show a tendency to loosen, the best tooth-paste is one\ncontaining potassium chlorate.\n\nAn alkaline mouth-wash should be used several times a day; after an\nattack of vomiting it is always advisable to rinse the mouth with\nsuch a solution. As a wash either lime water or milk of magnesia, or\na solution of bicarbonate of soda may be used; they are equally good.\nLime water may be prepared at home inexpensively in the following\nway: Place a teacupful of builders' lime in a large bowl and add two\nquarts of water; thoroughly mix and allow to settle. Pour off and\nthrow the water away, since it often contains impurities. Add two\nquarts of water again and allow the mixture to stand three or four\nhours, stirring occasionally. Strain through a piece of muslin into\nbottles and keep well corked. One tablespoonful of this solution\nshould be added to a glass of water to obtain the proper strength for\na mouth-wash.\n\nPRESSURE SYMPTOMS.--Because human beings walk erect, and not on all\nfours, they are liable to suffer from various ailments of pregnancy\nthat quadrupeds escape. Thus the upright posture is the chief factor,\nat least, in causing such complaints as swollen feet, varicose veins,\nhemorrhoids, and cramps in the legs. The attention of patients should\nbe called to the source of these troubles, for in most instances they\ncan be prevented by forethought and prudence.\n\nDuring the last two or three months of pregnancy every prospective\nmother should carefully avoid being too much on her feet; she should\nlie down, as has already been emphasized, at regular times of day and\nfrequently sit down to rest. Proper support for the abdomen, such as\nis afforded by a correct corset or a maternity supporter, lifts the\npregnant uterus, and to a notable extent relieves of pressure the\nstructures beneath it. On the other hand, incorrectly made corsets,\nthe use of circular garters, and running a sewing machine by foot-\npower all aggravate the pressure symptoms of pregnancy.\n\n_Swelling of the Feet_.--So long as the swelling is confined to\nthe feet and legs it does not mean that there is trouble with the\nkidneys; the swelling is satisfactorily explained by the pressure of\nthe enlarged uterus upon the veins which pass through the lower part\nof the abdomen and conduct the blood from the legs on its way back to\nthe heart. The womb is rarely heavy enough during the first half of\npregnancy to interfere with the flow of blood through these vessels,\nbut in the last few months such interference is very common.\n\nGenerally the limbs are equally affected, yet occasionally the\nswelling is more marked on one side or the other. The characteristic\nchanges begin in the feet. The skin covering the back of the foot\nbecomes tense and has a waxen appearance; it is easily indented,\nbearing for a moment the imprint of anything that is pressed against\nit. Often the swelling extends no higher than the ankles, but it may\ninvolve the calves, the thighs, or even the vulva, which is the\nregion between the thighs.\n\nIf the swelling remains slight, no attention need be paid to it. But\nif it becomes extensive or painful, nothing will give relief except\ngoing to bed. Patients observe for themselves that the swelling\nlessens during the night, and from this usually learn that the proper\ntreatment is rest. When it is absolutely impossible to remain in bed\nlong enough for the swelling to disappear, the next best plan is to\naccept every opportunity, during the day, to sit down and prop up the\nfeet.\n\n_Varicose Veins_.--The distention of the surface veins of the\nlegs, the condition known as varicose veins, is not a peculiarity of\npregnancy. Anyone who must be on his feet a great deal is liable to\nsuffer from this ailment. It is true, nevertheless, that pregnancy\nincreases the likelihood of the development of varicose veins. The\nwalls of the vessel are generally able to withstand whatever strain\nis placed upon them during the first pregnancy, and usually the\nvaricosed condition does not develop until after there have been\nseveral pregnancies.\n\nAs a rule, both legs are similarly affected, but if only one, it is\nmore likely to be the right. This is explained by the fact that the\nposition of the child within the womb is ordinarily such as to cause\ngreater pressure on the vessels of the right side. For the same\nreason when the legs are unequally affected, generally the veins of\nthe right side are the larger. In any case, however, the birth of the\nchild removes the source of the interference, and during the lying-in\nperiod, provided that the patient remains quiet for a sufficient\nlength of time, the vessels regain their normal caliber. Once they\nhave been distended, however, the veins remain more susceptible to\nengorgement. Consequently, in order not to increase the strain these\nvessels naturally bear during the latter months of pregnancy, the\nprecautions just mentioned for the avoidance of all the pressure\nsymptoms should be strictly observed. Upon the first intimation that\nthe veins are becoming dilated, a patient should be unusually careful\nto keep off her feet all that she can. Only in extreme cases will it\nbe compulsory to go to bed. But, if the veins are large and painful,\nshe should stay in bed until material improvement has taken place.\nSubsequently she should wear a flannel bandage, snugly applied, about\nthe leg from the toes to a point somewhat above the knee; the bandage\nshould extend higher whenever the veins of the thigh also are\ndilated. In putting on the bandage the heel may be left uncovered;\nafter leaving the foot a turn of the bandage will be taken around the\nankle and thence applied upward. A flannel bandage may be easily made\nat home. Bias strips are cut about three inches in width and sewed\ntogether end to end so that the joining will lie flat. Unless the\nbandage must extend far above the knee, eight yards will be a\nsufficient length.\n\nElastic stockings, which may be purchased from a druggist, serve the\nsame purpose as the bandage, but are very much less durable. Even if\nworn during the day they should be taken off at night; and when\nprotection of the veins is required after going to bed, the bandage\nis the most sanitary way of securing it.\n\nThe danger that one of the vessels will break may be disregarded, if\nthey are constantly protected by the measures that have been\nmentioned. In the event of accident, however, make firm pressure over\nthe bleeding point with a freshly laundered handkerchief, and apply\nan ice bag outside the dressing until the doctor arrives.\n\n_Hemorrhoids_.--Hemorrhoids are caused in the same way as\nvaricose veins of the legs. The two conditions differ merely in point\nof location; but hemorrhoids, on account of their location, are much\nmore exposed to irritation.\n\nAlthough the development of hemorrhoids cannot always be prevented,\nit is a well-known fact that constipation renders the chance of their\nappearance much greater. In a measure, therefore, regular, daily\nevacuation of the bowels serves to prevent the ailment, and also to\ncure it, once it has developed. But walking and even standing\naggravate hemorrhoids. The recumbent posture, as might be expected,\nis of itself frequently enough to give relief. It is much more likely\nto do so, however, if the hips are elevated by placing a pillow under\nthem.\n\nIn severe cases it is helpful to restrict the diet for a few days\nuntil the congestion and acute suffering have subsided. If the\nhemorrhoids protrude, they should be replaced (which the patient may\ngenerally do for herself), and an ice bag should be applied to the\nseat of pain. Various ointments and suppositories of different\ncomposition are valuable in the treatment of this ailment, but, as\nnot all cases are relieved by the same medicine, a physician should\nbe consulted to learn what is most suitable in any given instance.\n\nHemorrhoids often grow progressively worse as pregnancy advances, and\nare frequently aggravated immediately after the birth of the child;\nbut they generally disappear within a few weeks. Whenever a natural\ncure is not thus effected, it may become necessary to resort to\nsurgical treatment. Operative procedures, however, should not be\nundertaken during pregnancy, since the condition is likely to\nreappear before the child is born.\n\n_Cramps in the Legs_.--There are nerves as well as blood vessels\nthat the pregnant uterus may press upon, and pressure of this kind\nmay cause pain. At times the pain is definitely localized at the\npoint where the nerve is pressed upon; under these circumstances the\ndiscomfort is felt in the lower part of the back. On the other hand,\nthe pain may be referred to the point where the nerve ends. In this\nway is explained not only pain in the leg but also those sensations\nof numbness and tingling which prospective mothers not infrequently\ncomplain of. The presence of these pressure symptoms is usually\nlimited to the last few weeks of pregnancy. They often begin about\nthe time the child's head enters the bony canal through which it is\nultimately born; engagement of the head, as this is called, occurs\nsimultaneously with the dropping of the waist-line, that is, about\ntwo or three weeks before delivery. From the time the head is engaged\nall the pressure symptoms become somewhat more intense.\n\nFrom the very nature of their causation, it is clear that cramps in\nthe legs are difficult to treat. The recumbent posture lessens the\ndiscomfort, and, if in addition the hips are elevated, absolute\ncomfort will occasionally be secured. Whether or not the\nadministration of medicine is advisable must be determined by the\nphysician who has the opportunity to see the patient. The birth of\nthe child, of course, removes the cause of the pressure and\npermanently relieves this discomfort.\n\n_Shortness of Breath_.--Besides the ailments caused by the\ndownward pressure of the pregnant uterus, there are also symptoms due\nto its upward growth. Thus shortness of breath is regularly noted\ntoward the end of pregnancy, and, as has already been mentioned, it\nis one of the reasons for exercising leisurely.\n\nUnlike the other pressure symptoms, shortness of breath is ordinarily\naggravated by the recumbent posture, for lying flat on the back\nincreases the compression of the chest. At night, which is frequently\nthe time when difficulty in breathing is most pronounced, the patient\nmay, if necessary, sleep propped up in bed. For this purpose an\nappliance called a back-rest may be used, but an extra pillow under\nthe head and shoulders is usually sufficient.\n\nLEUCORRHEA.--The meaning of the white discharge from the vagina known\nas leucorrhea is variable: at times it indicates the existence of an\nailment requiring treatment, and at other times it does not. To be on\nthe safe side, therefore, anyone who is troubled by leucorrhea should\nobtain her physician's opinion as to its significance.\n\nNormally, as we learned in Chapter V, there is an increase in the\nvaginal secretion during pregnancy; but this fact is rarely\nnoticeable until the latter months. Usually it is pronounced only\nduring the last few weeks. At that time, owing to its antiseptic\nqualities, this pale white fluid should not be disturbed by the use\nof douches. In the early months of pregnancy, however, leucorrhea may\ncause such inconvenience as to demand medical treatment.\n\nWhile itching is the most disagreeable effect of such a vaginal\ndischarge, it should be known that itching is not always due to\nleucorrhea. Thus it may be caused by a highly concentrated urine, and\nin that event will be relieved by drinking a larger amount of water;\nor it may be due to the presence of unusual constituents in the\nurine. Skin diseases also cause itching; and light haired people,\nsince they have more delicate skins that brunettes, are especially\nsusceptible to these ailments. To such skin affections soap and water\nmay be very irritating; so that when they exist it is often advisable\nto cleanse the parts with olive oil. In other cases, ointments are\nrequired and will be prescribed by the physician.\n\nItching of the skin over the extremities or over the whole body, it\nis clear, cannot be attributed to leucorrhea, but in these very rare\ncases the irritation would seem to be caused by some waste product\nwhich is being eliminated through the sweat glands. We do not know\nwhat the substance is, but, as the symptom appears so seldom, it must\nbe due to an unusual kind of waste product or else to one whose\nelimination normally occurs through other channels. The affection of\nthe skin thus brought about is really a very mild kind of poisoning,\nand since the offending substance arises in the body of the patient\nherself the condition is called an autointoxication. Effective\ntreatment consists in drinking water freely and taking a cathartic,\nfor the one stimulates the kidneys and the other the bowels to assist\nin getting rid of the cause of the trouble.\n\nTOXEMIAS.--In order to understand what are known as the\ntoxemias of pregnancy, we must remember that the nutrition of our\nbodies involves three separate and distinct sets of processes. What\nwe eat is, in the first place, digested and absorbed into the body;\nsecondly, the products of digestion are utilized by the tissues; and,\nfinally, the waste material is thrown off from the body. Any one of\nthese processes may be carried out in a way that is not consistent\nwith health. Most of us realize that disturbances may occur in the\ncourse of digestion, and we are also aware that the excretory organs\noccasionally fail to do their work in a satisfactory way. But what\nlaymen, perhaps, do not appreciate is that the intermediary steps--\nbetween the time when the food is absorbed and the time when the\nwaste material is finally eliminated--may not be taken precisely as\nhealth requires. Of course, any person may be the subject of one or\nanother of these nutritional disorders, but unquestionably such\ndisorders are somewhat more frequent during pregnancy than at other\ntimes. Nor is this difficult to understand, for the nutritional\nprocesses of two beings are here linked together. They generally\nproceed harmoniously, but if they do not there results an\nautointoxication of the mother which is called a toxemia.\n\nSuch toxemias, with extremely rare exceptions, do not occur in the\nearly months, but are associated with the period of the active growth\nof the fetus, namely, the second half of pregnancy. For this reason,\nand for some others which do not concern us here, it seems probable\nthat the nutritional processes of the child are primarily responsible\nfor these ailments. This view, however, must be somewhat modified,\nfor experience has clearly taught that the efficiency with which the\nmaternal excretory organs do their work has a great deal to do with\nthe effect that the fetal waste products have upon the mother. On\nthis account she has been urged to pay attention to personal hygiene.\nIt is also necessary, however, that she should become acquainted with\nthe symptoms which give warning that the excretory organs are acting\nimperfectly.\n\nAutointoxication can almost always be prevented. The means of\nprevention are neither mysterious nor difficult to carry out; they\nlie within the power of every prospective mother, for they consist\nmerely of what has already been discussed, namely, the intelligent\nregulation of the diet, the care of the body, and a correct ordering\nof the daily life. To the chapters dealing with these subjects\nreference should be made and particular attention should be paid to\nwhat has been said concerning:\n\n  (1) Wearing suitably warm clothes,\n  (2) Bathing regularly,\n  (3) Taking a proper amount of exercise,\n  (4) Drinking water liberally,\n  (5) Avoiding an excessive quantity of meat,\n  (6) Guarding against constipation.\n\nAt present the value of prevention in the treatment of the toxemias\nof pregnancy is so clearly recognized that charitable organizations\nemploy nurses to visit women of the poorer classes during pregnancy\nin order to instruct them about the measures that I have just\nindicated. Remarkable results have already been obtained. In one\nclinic where this method has been adopted the frequency of all kinds\nof toxemia, I am told, has notably diminished, and serious types are\nnot permitted to develop. Similar results should be obtained in\nprivate practice when patients place themselves under medical\nsupervision at the beginning of pregnancy. Under these favorable\ncircumstances symptoms of autointoxication probably occur not oftener\nthan once in every hundred pregnancies, but nine out of ten of them,\nbeing promptly recognized, yield readily to relatively simple\ntreatment.\n\nThe early detection of such complications depends largely upon the\npatient herself. As has been emphasized--and it cannot be said too\nfrequently--she should not fail to submit, at appropriate intervals,\na specimen of urine for examination. It is by such an examination\ngenerally that the development of a toxemia is first detected.\nOccasionally, however, significant signs will attract the patient's\nattention before there is any change in the urine. For that reason,\nit is important to notify the physician if any of the following\nsymptoms appear:\n\n  (1) Serious vomiting.\n  (2) Persistent headache.\n  (3) Dizziness.\n  (4) Puffiness about the face.\n  (5) Blurring of vision, or the appearance of black\n      spots before the eyes.\n  (6) Neuralgic pains, especially in the pit of the stomach.\n\nIt must be clearly understood, however, that any of these symptoms\nmay be present without indicating that a toxemia is developing.\nNevertheless, they should be brought to the physician's attention\nwithout delay, and, at the same time, a specimen of urine should be\ngiven him for examination.\n\nAlthough the kidneys are not responsible for all the toxemias of\npregnancy, an analysis of the urine affords the most definite means\nof determining whether or not such a condition is present. When thus\ndetected, prompt treatment will guarantee to the patient almost\ncertain relief. On the other hand if, as usually happens, the\nanalysis shows conclusively that there is nothing serious the matter,\nthis reassurance fully justifies the trouble taken to secure it.",

        "content": "MISCARRIAGE\n\nFrequency--Causes and Prevention--Habitual Miscarriage--Warning\nSymptoms--After-effects--Criminal Abortion--Therapeutic Abortion--\nPremature Delivery.\n\nWe have learned that forty weeks are required for the full\ndevelopment of the human embryo, but this fact carries no assurance\nthat pregnancy will last so long; in reality, it may end abruptly at\nany time. If growth is interrupted before the twenty-eighth week (the\nseventh lunar month), the infant will be too immature to live. Even\nwhen born alive, it will usually perish within a few hours, or a few\ndays at most. Children born during the seventh month have\noccasionally survived; but the prevalent belief that they are more\nlikely to do so than if born a month later is erroneous. That\nsuperstition originated at a time when great virtue was ascribed to\nnumbers. Since seven was a sacred number, it was considered more\nauspicious to be born in the seventh month than in the eighth.\nUniversal experience, however, teaches us that the likelihood of\nrearing a premature child is, by a rapidly increasing proportion, the\ngreater for every week that it remains within the uterus. This is\nprecisely what we should expect, for the period of its existence\nthere measures the perfection of its development; and that, under\nordinary conditions, determines how strong and hardy the child will\nbe.\n\nAlthough during the first six months the outlook for the infant will\nbe equally unfavorable at whatever time pregnancy may be interrupted,\nphysicians prefer to distinguish cases which terminate in the earlier\npart of this period from those which terminate in the latter part.\nFor technical reasons, the sixteenth week represents a natural point\nof division. A birth which takes place before that time is called an\nabortion; one which takes place between the sixteenth and the twenty-\neighth week is called a miscarriage. The anatomical reasons which\njustify such a distinction do not concern us here, and the matter\ndeserves mention merely because the same terms are often employed in\na very different sense by the laity. As most of us know, the\ninterruption of pregnancy results sometimes from purely natural\ncauses, and sometimes from the employment of artificial means. As a\nrule, persons who are unacquainted with medical terminology call a\nbirth of the former kind a miscarriage, and reserve the term abortion\nfor an interruption of pregnancy that is deliberately provoked.\nPhysicians, however, make no such distinction. They use these words,\nas I have said, simply to indicate how far development has progressed\nbefore the termination of pregnancy. Since the term abortion is apt\nto carry with it the implication of a criminal act, confusion will be\navoided if we agree for the time to depart from strictly medical\nusage and designate as miscarriage the spontaneous termination of\npregnancy prior to the twenty-eighth week.\n\nFREQUENCY.--Early interruption of pregnancy is extremely common. Some\nsociologists declare that it is becoming more and more frequent, and\nsee in it a grave national danger. French statesmen attribute the\nalarming decline of the birth-rate in their country, in great part,\nto a rapid increase in the number of pregnancies which end\nprematurely. Reliable English and German statistics indicate that of\nthe pregnancies which come under the observation of physicians\napproximately twenty per cent, end in miscarriage. In our own\ncountry, though extensive and complete data are not available, it is\nlikely that the incidence is equally high.\n\nThe actual frequency of miscarriage is generally underestimated.\nPatients themselves often do not know what has really happened. When\nthe accident occurs a few days after conception, bleeding may be its\nonly evidence, which will almost certainly be misinterpreted as an\nirregularity of menstruation; and professional advice will not often\nbe thought necessary. Moreover, in other cases in which the true\nsituation is appreciated the patient does not feel sick enough to\nseek medical assistance. If it were possible to include in the\nstatistics all these cases as well as those which are concealed\nbecause intentionally provoked, the frequency with which pregnancy is\ninterrupted during the early months would be found somewhat greater\nthan is usually supposed.\n\nIf we omit the miscarriages which occur within the first few weeks of\npregnancy, and which consequently often escape detection, the\nmajority of cases fall within the second and third months. After the\nfourth month has passed, the probability of such an accident, though\nnot excluded, is greatly diminished. Some statistics recently\npublished by Taussig make this clear. In a series of several hundred\ncases of miscarriage, one hundred and fifty-seven instances occurred\nin the second month, two hundred and twenty-two in the third month,\nseventy-three in the fourth month, thirty-seven in the fifth month,\nand five in the sixth month. This order of frequency might be\nanticipated from the anatomical conditions which prevail during the\nearly months of pregnancy, since the attachment of the embryo to the\nmother is at first relatively insecure, but gradually grows firmer,\nand becomes as secure as it ever will be by about the fifth month.\n\nIt is noteworthy that miscarriage occurs much less commonly in the\nfirst than in subsequent pregnancies. Indeed, a somewhat greater\nliability to the accident with each succeeding pregnancy goes far\ntoward explaining the greater frequency of miscarriage among women\nwho have passed the thirty-fifth year than among those who are\nyounger.\n\nCAUSES AND PREVENTION.--We have seen that the proportion of\npregnancies which end in miscarriage is quite formidable. But this\nshould not be true, as the accident is frequently preventable, and\nmany of these accidents could be avoided by the cooperation of\npatients. As self-denial and personal inconvenience are often\nessential, it is only fair to explain their value. Furthermore, the,\npatient who appreciates the reason for certain directions the\nphysician gives becomes responsible to herself, and is much more\nlikely to carry them out than is one who is cautioned without\nreceiving a satisfactory explanation. At best, however, the advice\nwhich the physician is able to offer will be imperfect, for it must\nnot be imagined that everything is known concerning the causation and\nprevention of miscarriage. While our knowledge is so imperfect we\nmust be content to make the most of what we possess. It must be added\nthat no suggestion such as can be given here will enable anyone to\ndispense with her own medical adviser. On the contrary, if there is\nreason to fear miscarriage, the prospective mother should be\nencouraged to seek his counsel as early as possible. Aside from the\nhygienic measures which she may learn to carry out for herself,\nvarious drugs are often of great value in preventing miscarriage.\nSince these are not applicable to all cases, they should be employed\nonly upon medical advice.\n\nVery early miscarriages may be explained by the loose attachment of\nthe ovum during the first six weeks of pregnancy. This tiny, living\nsphere, it will be recalled, reaches the womb a few days after\nconception, and adheres to the uterine mucous membrane. At first,\nhowever, its roots are short and delicate, and not so capable of\nanchoring the ovum as they become later. It is only toward the end of\nthe eighteenth week that the union between the womb and its contents\nbecomes firm.\n\nFrom what we have learned in Chapter II regarding the anatomical\nconditions in the early days of pregnancy it is obvious that we need\nnot be greatly surprised at the frequency of miscarriage. On the\nother hand, it must not be forgotten that there are many natural\nsafeguards against accident: to mention only one, the uterus is\ningeniously swung in the abdominal cavity so as to afford a large\nmeasure of protection against mechanical shock. Usually, the\nprovisions nature has made are sufficient to resist forces from\nwithout which tend to dislodge the ovum. Now and then it happens that\nthe most irrational acts will not interrupt pregnancy; indeed, they\noften seem particularly inert when practised intentionally.\n\nFear of loosening the ovum from its uterine attachment prompts\nexperienced women to caution prospective mothers against any kind of\nsudden or violent effort. Their advice, however, is often needlessly\nalarming; a great many traditional precautions lack a reasonable\nbasis. Thus, no harm can possibly result from sleeping with the arms\nabove the head; nor from \"over-reaching,\" as when hanging a picture,\nthough a fall under such circumstances might be dangerous.\n\nPatients who have been warned by one experience should always be on\ntheir guard if they would avoid repeated miscarriages; others need\nonly lead a sensible, hygienic life, a matter we have already\ndiscussed in the chapters dealing with the care of the body and the\nway to live. For the sake of emphasis, I may here repeat that no\nprospective mother should become fatigued from any cause; sweeping,\nmoving heavy furniture, lifting heavy articles, and running a sewing\nmachine are not to be attempted. But household duties which do not\nrequire strong muscular effort are better assumed than not.\n\nAmusements which may cause jolting, or expose one to the danger of\nfalling, involve some risk of miscarriage. Short rides in a carriage\nor an automobile over smooth roads are free from objection. Railway-\ntravel and sea-voyages are not advisable in the early months; after\nthe eighteenth week they may be undertaken with a greater degree of\nsafety, provided comfortable accommodations are assured, and the\npatient has never had a miscarriage.\n\nA few physicians, even at present, attribute the interruption of\npregnancy to strong emotions, including intense joy or sorrow, anger,\nfright, or even jealousy. Without denying altogether the possibility\nof such an influence, we may be sure that its importance is greatly\nexaggerated. It is not unusual to see patients who are able to recall\na mental shock of some kind shortly before the miscarriage occurred;\nnevertheless, in such cases diligent search will usually reveal a\nphysical cause for the accident.\n\nAnother popular fallacy relates to the effect of drugs upon\npregnancy. The use of castor oil and other strong purgatives do not\ninterrupt it. Should the administration of any cathartic be followed\nby miscarriage, some fault inherent preexisted in the pregnancy, and\nno amount of precaution would have enabled the patient to reach full\nterm successfully. Quinin in tonic doses may be taken with impunity,\nand even larger quantities are being constantly used for the cure of\nmalaria without doing the pregnancy any harm. Many other drugs are\nreputed to have great efficacy in causing the expulsion of the\nproduct of conception; unfortunately, they are too well known to\nrequire enumeration. They are usually unreliable, and are absolutely\ninefficient in doses small enough not to endanger the mother's life,\nprovided the pregnancy is a healthy one.\n\nInstances in which miscarriage is attributed to the use of some drug\nare quite common, and we cannot dismiss them without a word of\nexplanation. Such cases generally fall into one of two classes. Often\na drug is given credit for efficiency where conception has been\nerroneously suspected. Shortly after the menstrual date passes, some\nmedicine is resorted to, and the subsequent phenomenon, regarded as\nthe interruption of pregnancy, is really no more than normal\nmenstruation. In another group of cases miscarriage does actually\noccur, although the medicine employed plays only a minor role in its\nproduction. In such instances the irritation which the drug occasions\nis the last link in a chain of events leading up to the miscarriage,\nbut the main factor lies in some fundamental imperfection in the\npregnancy. Physicians recognize a variety of these imperfections, and\nknow that they may be located in the womb, in the embryo, or in the\ntissues which unite the one with the other. As an intimate knowledge\nof pathology is often necessary to recognize the underlying, and\ntherefore the actual, cause of the miscarriage, it is not at all\nsurprising that patients frequently err in their interpretations of\nsuch accidents, and emphasize unimportant matters.\n\nIt would lead us too far afield to attempt to discuss every cause of\nmiscarriage. Nevertheless, there are some very important ones, not\nyet mentioned, which should be understood by the laity, as\nappreciation of their significance may avert trouble. In some\ninstances, on the other hand, the accident is unavoidable; to know\nthis should afford the patient a large measure of comfort.\n\nIrregularities in the position of the womb are often responsible for\nmiscarriage. Such a condition may exist in women who have not borne\nchildren, but it is far more likely to occur as a result of\nchildbirth. After delivery, the enlarged womb becomes the seat of\nintricate changes, the purpose of which is the restoration of the\norgan to the condition which existed before conception. It dwindles\nin size, and gradually drops to its accustomed location within the\npelvic cavity. Six weeks are usually required for these changes.\n\nAt the time of birth it is impossible to predict whether the womb\nwill finally resume a satisfactory position. Accordingly, an\nexamination two to four weeks later is essential. In four out of five\npatients the organ will be found in its proper location, but, even\nthough it is not, suitable measures adopted at once will generally\nserve to replace and hold it in good position. On the other hand, if\nthe malposition is not recognized until months or years later, simple\nprocedures will prove inefficient, and a surgical operation will\nbecome necessary. Were there no other reason for a careful\nexamination at the end of the lying-in period, it would be amply\njustified by the information which it gives relative to the position\nof the uterus.\n\nAlthough there can be no doubt that the routine correction of uterine\ndisplacements shortly after labor would go far toward restricting the\noccurrence of subsequent miscarriage, it would be incorrect to leave\nthe impression that miscarriage will always occur if the uterus is\nout of its normal position. Not infrequently the changes wrought by\npregnancy will cause the uterus to right itself spontaneously.\n\nAnother important cause of miscarriage consists in abnormalities in\nthe lining of the uterus. Through inherent defect or acquired disease\nthis tissue may become unsuited for anchoring or nourishing an ovum.\nIn either event, a surgical procedure, known as curettage, affords\nthe most likely means of restoring it to a healthful state. The\noperation removes the old lining; and a new one quickly develops,\nwhich is often more capable of fulfilling the purpose for which it is\nintended.\n\nAn appreciable number of miscarriages depend upon conditions over\nwhich medical skill has no control. Under such circumstances, though\nthe accident may be regretted, there is no room for remorse or\ncensure. Often the embryo should bear the blame; if its development\nis imperfect or if it dies, miscarriage usually occurs very promptly.\n\nWe are familiar also with a few maternal conditions which seriously\naffect the embryo, often seriously enough to cause its expulsion,\nalive or dead. In this respect, certain constitutional disorders are\npreeminent. Bright's disease and diabetes are prejudicial to the\ndevelopment of the embryo; women suffering from either of them must\nbe watched with great care. Occasionally, such pregnancies come to a\npremature end in spite of every precaution. Various infectious\ndiseases, as typhoid fever and pneumonia, also are fatal to the\nembryo if the causative bacteria pass into it. Fortunately this\nrarely happens, since the placenta generally affords an effectual\nbarrier to their entrance into the embryo. Organic diseases of the\nmother's heart also may bring about miscarriage. A patient thus\naffected should place herself under the supervision of a physician as\nsoon as conception is suspected.\n\nNow and then physicians are completely at a loss to explain cases of\nmiscarriage. Our ignorance is unfortunate, particularly when repeated\nmiscarriages have occurred and their causation cannot be detected.\n\nHABITUAL MISCARRIAGE.--Experience teaches that women who have had one\nmiscarriage must be more careful than other prospective mothers if\nthey would escape a repetition of the accident. Persons who know\nthemselves to be subject to miscarriage should regard no precaution\nas too burdensome. Not only should they avoid motoring, driving,\nrailroad journeys, sea voyages, and every kind of strenuous exertion,\nthey must accept every opportunity to be quiet and rest. Often such\nhygienic care yields sufficient protection; but occasionally medicine\nis also necessary.\n\nA number of causes are at hand to explain habitual miscarriage, but,\nin fairness, it must be acknowledged that physicians are not able to\ninterpret all cases. With one class of patients the muscle fibers of\nthe womb are peculiarly irritable, whereas in another its lining\nproves incapable of firmly anchoring the ovum. Moreover, derangements\nof organs which do not belong to the reproductive group may be\nresponsible for the habit.\n\nIt is a curious fact that the accident is most likely to occur when\nmenstruation would be expected were the individual not pregnant.\nObviously, extraordinary precaution is advisable at such times, and\nif the patient would avoid even the slightest risk, she should not\nleave her bed. The same purpose will not be served by sitting quietly\nin a chair, nor by reclining on a couch; complete relaxation and\ncomposure are secured only when one lies flat on the back, loosely\nattired in sleeping garments. I have known several persons with a\ntendency toward miscarriage who overcame it in this way. Recently one\nof them who had been delivered prematurely on two former occasions,\nand who was anxious for a successful issue to her third pregnancy,\nwas willing to remain in bed practically the whole period of\ngestation. She had her reward; a well-developed infant was born at\nfull term, and has continued to thrive.\n\nProlonged rest in bed, some will say, is debilitating. While that may\nbe true to a degree, untoward effects can always be avoided by\nsystematic massage of the extremities. The abdomen should not be\nsubjected to such manipulations, for they will occasionally provoke\npainful contractions of the uterus and defeat the purpose of staying\nin bed.\n\nPatients who are not disposed to undergo a long period of enforced\nrest, no matter what profit may be promised, should at least consent\nto keep in bed during that period of pregnancy at which a previous\nmiscarriage took place. We know that the event is particularly apt to\nrecur at such a time. Specifically, it is important to remain in bed\none week before and one week after the date in question.\n\nWhen pregnancies follow one another in rapid succession, the\nliability to miscarriage is notably increased. A natural interval\nbetween births has been provided, an interval which depends upon the\nmother nursing her child. Ideally, menstruation, and with it the\nripening of the ova (egg-cells), does not occur while the breasts are\nactive; but when the infant does not suckle, the ovaries regularly\nresume their function in a very short time. Since the circumstances\nattending miscarriage always deprive the mother of the opportunity of\nnursing, another pregnancy may quickly ensue unless these facts are\nappreciated.\n\nThose who anticipate the possibility of a premature interruption of\npregnancy should realize that the marital relation is inadvisable\nafter conception has taken place. For others, who have no reason to\nexpect irregularity in the course of pregnancy, such a precaution is\nunnecessary. None the less, women who marry late in life or who first\nconceive toward the time of the menopause will do well to follow the\nsame rule. The risk of accident may be very slight, but conservative\npersons will not assume it when the likelihood of subsequent\nconception is doubtful.\n\nNot infrequently the fundamental reason for habitual miscarriage lies\nin some anatomical abnormality which a surgical operation alone can\ncorrect. As the necessity for interference can be determined only\nafter a careful examination, recommendations of wide application are\nnot possible. Nothing short of painstaking study of each case will\nafford a basis for advice and action.\n\nSYMPTOMS.--Very definite warning usually precedes a miscarriage, but\nthe threatening symptoms vary greatly in severity and duration. If\nappropriate measures are taken promptly, these symptoms may disappear\nwith no harmful result Everyone concedes that bleeding and pain are\nthe chief indications of impending miscarriage, although an\noccasional patient, profiting by former experience, may find other\nsigns prophetic in her own case.\n\nMature women, accustomed to the regular monthly function of their\nsex, are prone to treat with indifference a slight discharge of blood\noccurring during pregnancy. Indeed, it is widely believed that\nmenstruation frequently continues after conception. In point of fact,\nhowever, it is very unusual in early pregnancy, and becomes entirely\nimpossible after the fourth month. Accordingly, whenever vaginal\nbleeding is noticed, some other explanation should be sought; and the\npatient who would adopt the wisest plan should assume that she is\nthreatened with miscarriage. There are other possibilities, but these\nare for her doctor to consider.\n\nIt is true that small hemorrhages are not necessarily followed by\nmiscarriage. One may even experience slight loss of blood repeatedly,\nand yet give birth to a healthy child at the natural end of\npregnancy. None the less, bleeding, however moderate, should always\nexcite suspicion, as we know it usually denotes the breaking to some\ndegree of the connection between mother and child. The extent of the\nseparation usually determines the degree of the hemorrhage, which in\nturn indicates the seriousness of the accident. The fate of the fetus\nwill depend upon the area of placenta, which has been incapacitated.\nFlooding, however, always imperils the fetus, and generally warrants\nthe inference that so much of the placenta has been separated as to\nrender further development impossible. On the other hand, so long as\nthe hemorrhage does not exceed the customary flow at the monthly\nperiods, the life of the child is rarely endangered; while a\nchocolate-colored discharge, and even the loss of small clots, may\ncontinue indefinitely without doing serious harm. Under such\ncircumstances, however, the patient should communicate with her\nmedical adviser, and should save for his inspection whatever may be\nexpelled.\n\nPain, the other conspicuous symptom of threatened miscarriage, has\nnot a uniform significance. Since it frequently occurs during the\ncourse of pregnancy in association with a number of conditions, it is\nnot a reliable sign of danger. Moreover, the susceptibility to pain\nvaries; thus, of two patients in the same stage of threatened\nmiscarriage one may suffer intensely, while the other remains\ncomparatively comfortable.\n\nTypically, the onset of miscarriage is attended by discomfort in the\nsmall of the back, which may be continuous, but more often is\nintermittent. If preventive measures are instituted at the outset,\nthere is hope of relieving the discomfort and averting the\nmiscarriage; but if the warning goes unheeded, the pain will\ngradually shift to the lower part of the abdomen and become more\nsevere. It often happens that the cramp-like abdominal pain of\nthreatened miscarriage is confused with that associated with\nintestinal indigestion. A simple test will sometimes decide the\nquestion. If due to the latter cause, the discomfort will usually\nyield to a teaspoonful of paregoric, whereas it will be without\neffect if miscarriage is imminent. Exceptions to this rule are not\nuncommon, yet a better one cannot be given; as a physician, even\nafter considering the technical evidence, may find it impossible to\ndecide at once whether or not miscarriage is threatened.\n\nNo confidence can be placed in many so-called signs of miscarriage,\nthough implicitly trusted by the laity. Lassitude, depression of\nspirits, and general bodily ill-feeling may forecast the interruption\nof pregnancy; but more frequently they have no such significance. The\nsame estimate holds true of other symptoms, including diarrhea and a\npersistent inclination to empty the bladder. Nor does fever always\nlead to the termination of pregnancy. A moderate rise of temperature\nis without significance; but high fever, persisting for several days,\nmay result in the death of the fetus and subsequent miscarriage.\nNevertheless, prolonged febrile affections, such as typhoid fever,\nfrequently leave pregnancy unharmed.\n\nSo long as the symptoms are confined to slight bleeding and mild\nattacks of pain, physicians regard miscarriage merely as threatened.\nIf the bleeding increases, the outlook becomes less favorable, and,\nas I have said, miscarriage is inevitable when it amounts to\nflooding. Likewise, rupture of the sack containing the fetus, with\nescape of the amniotic fluid, indicates that the culmination of\nevents will not long be delayed.\n\nThe most favorable outcome is when the entire contents of the womb\nare spontaneously expelled, which unfortunately does not always\noccur. There is, to be sure, rarely any difficulty in the natural\nbirth of the fetus, for its meager development prevents serious\ncomplications. The separation and extrusion of the placenta, on the\ncontrary, are apt to be imperfect when pregnancy ends in the early\nmonths, and medical attention is necessary to determine whether the\nuterus has been emptied completely. This is particularly important,\nbecause the retention of placental tissue affords opportunity for\nseveral unpleasant complications; and neglect in this regard accounts\nin part for the belief that miscarriage is certain to leave women\nirreparably broken in health.\n\nAFTER-EFFECTS.--No one will deny that invalidism follows the untimely\ninterruption of pregnancy more often than the birth of children at\nfull term. This is not due, as is sometimes said, to the fact that a\nmiscarriage differs from a normal birth in that it is unnatural, for\nother reasons are apparent. One of them, the retention of placental\ntissue, has just been mentioned, but serious consequences resulting\nfrom it are almost inexcusable, for, although the placenta may\nseparate less readily and be cast off less thoroughly after\nmiscarriage, modern medical skill can successfully cope with such\nconditions. Another fruitful source of unfortunate after-effects is\nthe imprudence of the patient. Women should remain in bed fully as\nlong after a miscarriage as after the birth of a mature infant; if\nthey would consent to do so, many ill-effects would be averted. But\nphysicians frequently encounter strong opposition to precautionary\nmeasures such as this. Many patients argue, illogically, that less\nprecaution is necessary since pregnancy failed to attain its natural\nconclusion, and infer that the earlier that it ends the more quickly\none may leave the bed. In point of fact, even greater precaution is\nrequired than if all had gone normally. Still a third cause for ill-\nhealth may be found in physical ailments which antedated the\nmiscarriage but were not recognized until after its occurrence.\n\nInvalidism which follows pregnancy and which may be fairly regarded\nas chargeable to it depends, in most instances, upon an infection\nacquired at the time of delivery. Infection occurs more frequently\nwhen pregnancy ends during the early months, because in this category\nis included the great majority of criminal abortions, which are\nusually induced without regard for surgical cleanliness. Fatal\ncomplications, or serious consequences which narrowly escape a fatal\nending, are common among women who attempt to rid themselves of an\nunwelcome pregnancy. As they are ignorant of aseptic precautions,\ntheir manipulations must necessarily contaminate the site of\noperation; for this reason and others as well women who attempt to\nperform an abortion upon themselves imperil their lives. The danger\nis scarcely less when abortion is induced unlawfully by incompetent\noperators; for lack of skill, the need of secrecy, and the desire of\nhaste all interfere with necessary aseptic technique. Everyone knows\nthat sad accidents befall those who submit to such operations; but it\nis not generally recognized that these cases are largely responsible\nfor the ill-repute borne by miscarriage in general. On the other\nhand, properly supervised miscarriages are attended by no greater\ndanger and probably less than delivery at full term.\n\nCRIMINAL ABORTION.--The destruction of a pregnancy, except when its\ncontinuance threatens the life of the patient, is forbidden by law.\nThe important ethical and religious aspects of the act which the law\nthus stigmatizes as criminal we may properly neglect. Although\nvarious religions present a diversity of teaching relative to its\nmoral nature, all agree in regarding it as sinful. Equally important,\nhowever, is the fact that no matter what opinion anyone may hold as\nto the morality of the act he is bound to obey the law. This is\napparently not clearly understood by the laity, for many persons\nthink that a physician may terminate pregnancy whenever he is so\ninclined. If the liability to criminal prosecution which a physician\nwould assume should he comply with a request for the means of\ndestroying pregnancy were clearly realized, patients would not\nbeseech him to incur the risk of heavy find and long imprisonment\nmerely to gratify their own convenience or to save them from\ndisgrace.\n\nThe Common Law, an inheritance from England, enriched with\nauthoritative decisions by our own courts, is the groundwork of the\nlaw in all the States, and its principles are binding in the absence\nof express statutes. At Common Law, abortion is punishable as\n_homicide_ when the woman dies or when the operation results\nfatally to the infant after it has been born alive. If performed for\nthe purpose of killing the child, the crime is _murder_; in the\nabsence of such intent, it is _manslaughter_. _The woman who\ncommits an abortion upon herself is likewise guilty of the crime._\n\nThe great majority of those who desire the interruption of pregnancy\nfeel they have not assumed an illegal position so long as they avoid\ninstrumental procedures. That is not correct, for even at Common Law\nit is a misdemeanor to bring about the death of an unborn child _by\nthe use of drugs or by any other means_.\n\nAt Common Law there was a difference of opinion as to whether all\ninduced abortions were illegal. Many courts formerly held that\nquickening was a necessary prerequisite; but under the modern\nstatutes, practically without exception, the law disregards the\nperiod of pregnancy at which the abortion is provoked. Since the time\nof conception determines the beginning of embryonic development, to\nprove that the act was committed before fetal movements were\nperceived is no longer a valid defense. This has been emphatically\nstated by Judge Coulter, of Pennsylvania, who said: \"_It is not the\nmurder of a living child which constitutes the offense, but the\ndestruction of gestation by wicked means and against nature. The\nmoment the womb is instinct with embryonic life and gestation has\nbegun, the crime may be perpetrated._\"\n\nEach commonwealth has enacted its own statutes for the regulation of\nabortion. In many states, simply _to seek the means for destroying\npregnancy is a criminal act_. Thus, Indiana, perhaps the most\nprogressive of the States in reconstructing its criminal code to\naccord with modern sociological teaching, has enacted a law which I\nquote from Burn's Indiana Statutes, Revision of 1908, Vol. I, page\n1029. \"Every woman who shall solicit of any person any medicine, drug\nor substance, or thing whatever and shall take the same, or shall\nsubmit to any operation or other means whatever with intent thereby\nto procure a miscarriage, except when done by a physician for the\npurpose of saving the life of the mother or child, shall, on\nconviction, be fined not less than ten dollars, and be imprisoned in\nthe county jail not less than thirty days nor more than one year.\" To\ninclude the woman as a party to the crime is a signal mark of\nprogress toward bringing abortion under effective legal control.\nHeretofore, the perpetrator alone has been responsible, and in most\nStates he remains so, while the woman is regarded as a victim.\nClearly, that is unjust, for criminal abortions are rarely, if ever,\nperformed without application by the subject of the operation.\nAccording to most of the statutes no distinction is made between the\nattempt at abortion and its accomplishment. Irrespective of the\noutcome, those who supply drugs or employ instruments purposing the\ndestruction of pregnancy are guilty of the offense.\n\nAn extensive analysis of the various State laws is unnecessary; the\nmention of a few statutes, selected from different sections of the\ncountry, will suffice to indicate the character of prevalent\nlegislation. Massachusetts imprisons those found guilty of abortion\nfor a period of three years or less, and permits a fine of one\nthousand dollars. In Pennsylvania the same prison sentence is\nimposed, though the fine may not exceed five hundred dollars. Three\nyears is the minimum imprisonment in Virginia, and a maximum of ten\nyears is allowed. Colorado's law duplicates that of Massachusetts.\nCalifornia imposes no fine, and prescribes a sentence of from two to\nfive years in the State prison. All the statutes make the offense\nmuch graver when the woman dies as a result of the practice. Under\nthese circumstances, the crime never takes lower rank than\nmanslaughter; and generally it is murder.\n\nEvidently we possess sufficiently stringent laws regarding criminal\nabortion; yet, as everyone knows, they do not prevent perpetration of\nthe crime. On good authority, we are informed that eighty thousand\nunlawful abortions are performed annually in New York, in spite of a\npossible penalty of four years in the State prison. This is due in\npart to difficulty in securing evidence and failure to prosecute when\nevidence could be gathered, but more particularly to the fact that\nthe general public does not appreciate the gravity of the offense.\nThe same feeling is illustrated in the advertising of abortifacients.\nNewspapers and magazines unhesitatingly carry, under the guise of\nremedies to regulate the health of women, notices of drugs and\nequipment intended to destroy pregnancy. This is expressly forbidden\nby many statutes. [Footnote: Thus, the Maryland law provides that\n\"any person who shall knowingly advertise, print, publish, distribute\nor circulate any pamphlet, printed paper, book, newspaper notice,\nadvertisement or reference containing words or language or conveying\nany notice, hint, or reference to any person or to the name of any\nperson, real or fictitious, from whom, or to any place, house, shop,\nor office, where any poison, drug, mixture, preparation, medicine, or\nnoxious thing or any instrument or means whatever; or from whom\nadvice, direction, information or knowledge may be obtained for the\npurpose of causing the miscarriage or abortion of any woman pregnant\nwith child, at any period of pregnancy, shall be punished by\nimprisonment in the penitentiary for not less than three years, by a\nfine of not less than five hundred dollars, nor more than one\nthousand dollars, or by both, in the discretion of the court.\"]\n\nThe knowledge that prohibitory laws exist is sufficient to deter\nreputable physicians from illegal practice; whereas known laxity in\nthe enforcement of the law continually tempts unscrupulous persons to\nprovoke abortion. Among the poorer classes the procedure is\nundertaken by ignorant women, while persons in more comfortable\ncircumstances avail themselves of the services of medical men who are\nusually incompetent and value money above professional honor. The net\nresult is an unpardonable death-rate and a large proportion of\ninvalids. Aside from the legal aspect of the act, the element of\npersonal danger would seem a warning to be heeded by women who\ncontemplate becoming a party to this crime.\n\nTHERAPEUTIC ABORTION.--If a woman is suffering from tuberculosis or\nsome organic affection, pregnancy may add a serious strain upon the\nalready crippled machinery of her body. Occasionally gestation itself\nmay cause changes which threaten life. In either event the duty of\nthe physician is plain. The law is acquainted with such emergencies,\nand explicitly permits the termination of pregnancy when undertaken\nto relieve or cure such conditions. When performed to restore health\nthe operation is called therapeutic abortion.\n\nThe Maryland law, for example, grants the right to induce abortion\nwhenever two or more physicians see the patient and agree that \"no\nother method will secure the safety of the mother.\" Similar rules are\nprescribed by the statutes of other States, but none concedes the\nright of abortion as a means of keeping the woman from suicide.\n\nSince therapeutic abortions are legal, they may be done openly; hence\nthe operation is performed in appropriate surroundings and with every\nrefinement of surgical technique. These fortunate conditions\nmaterially alter the outlook; serious consequences of the operation\nitself need not be feared. Competent surgeons, employing modern\nmethods, may perform hundreds of abortions without the loss of a\nsingle patient. Moreover, pregnancy may be terminated safely and\nexpeditiously at any time; the lay view which regards abortion as\nmore serious after the second month than before it is a relic of days\ngone by.\n\nPREMATURE DELIVERY.--In the introduction to this chapter we noted\nthat the infant becomes viable after the twenty-eighth week, which\nmarks in a practical sense, the transition of the fetus from an\nimmature to a premature stage of development. In point of frequency,\npremature delivery ranks far below either abortion or miscarriage.\n\nUnlawful interference with pregnancy generally proceeds from a desire\nto avoid offspring, and lacks incentive after the infant becomes\ncapable of living independently. Criminal operations, therefore, are\nnot a conspicuous cause of premature delivery. Occasionally\nphysicians resort to artificial means to end gestation during the\nlater months in order that organic complications may be relieved; but\nmost premature births occur spontaneously. Sometimes they are due to\nill-health, while in other instances no evidence of disease is found\nin either mother or child. Careful study of the individual patient,\nhowever, is generally helpful toward the prevention of repeated\npremature delivery.\n\nThe course of premature labor closely resembles delivery at full\nterm. But it is shorter because the infant is small; and the\nsubsequent loss of blood is not so great. The recovery of the mother\nis never retarded by the fact of earlier delivery, though the\nconditions which caused it may prevent rapid convalescence.\n\nThe outlook for the infant depends upon a great many factors. Most\nimportant among them is the perfection of its development, which may\nbe estimated most satisfactorily from its weight and length.\nOccasionally children have been reared when they weighed as little as\nthree pounds, but hope that they will survive should not be\nentertained unless they weigh four pounds or more. This is attained\nabout eight weeks before maturity, and corresponds to a length of\nforty centimeters (16 inches), measured from the crown of the head to\nthe heel. Premature children perish, most frequently, either from\nincomplete development of their heat-regulating apparatus, which\npredisposes them to pneumonia, or from imperfections in the digestive\nfunctions, which increase the liability to malnutrition. To overcome\nthe first danger, incubators have been devised and have become\nfamiliar to everyone through public exhibitions. A basket or box\nsupplied with hot-water bottles answers the same purpose, and has the\nadvantage of better ventilation. The second danger can be overcome\nonly by proper feeding. Breast-milk provides the most reliable\nnourishment for premature infants. If the mother cannot supply it, a\nwet-nurse should be procured, and, if the infant has not the strength\nto suckle, the milk should be drawn from the breast and fed with a\nmedicine-dropper or a spoon.\n\nIn addition to providing proper food and maintaining an even body-\ntemperature, care must also be taken to protect these infants from\nvarious harmful influences such as too much handling, strong light,\nand loud noises. Although every precaution be observed, frequently\nall counts for nothing; but if the child does thrive, there is no\nreason for worry about its ultimate development. When a premature\ninfant lives, the same chances for adult health await it as it would\nhave had if born in its due time.",

They desire their preparations to be\nthorough, reliable, and in accord with the most approved methods of\ntreatment, for they realize that preparations along these lines will\nnot only prevent haste and confusion at the time of birth, but will\nalso promote a satisfactory convalescence. Apparently trivial details\noften safeguard confinement against serious accident. Indeed,\nmeasures which aim at the prevention of illness form the chief asset\nof modern obstetrics, and of these none takes higher rank than the\nmaintenance of strict cleanliness during and after childbirth. This\nfact fortunately is widely appreciated at present, and not a few\nwomen inquire voluntarily the means of observing the proper\nprecautions. It is true, of course, that even today many women are\ndelivered in filthy rooms and upon dirty beds, and that in spite of\nsuch surroundings some of them make a good recovery. Yet grave\ncomplications develop much more frequently among those who have not\npaid attention to the preparations for confinement.\n\nThe surgical dressings and other supplies do not require attention in\nthe early months of pregnancy. A number of articles, invaluable when\ndelivery occurs at full term, are useless if the fetus is immature\nand cannot live, and therefore it is unnecessary to provide them\nuntil two or three months before the confinement is expected. In the\nevent of a miscarriage what is needed can be procured upon very short\nnotice. But, on the other hand, delivery subsequent to the twenty-\neighth week may require all the equipment useful at full term so that\neverything should be in readiness by that time.\n\nENGAGING THE NURSE.--As soon as the existence of pregnancy is clearly\nrecognized the patient should select the doctor and the nurse who\nwill attend her. Prompt selection of a nurse will assure the widest\nchoice, for proficient nurses are in demand and book engagements far\nin advance of the date they will be needed. Furthermore, it is a\nrelief to the patient to have her attendants selected. The\npossibility of premature delivery never interferes with engaging the\nnurse very early in pregnancy, for that accident releases both\npatient and nurse from their contract.\n\nNurses demand that the date be specified upon which an engagement\nshall begin, as, unless their calendar is definitely arranged, they\nare unable to earn a livelihood. This leads to a question which is\ndifficult to answer, for the precise day of delivery is uncertain;\nconsequently to fix the beginning of the engagement may prove a\ntroublesome matter. On the one hand, there is risk of having to pay\nthe nurse for a time before her services are actually needed; on the\nother, a false economy may result in the absence of the chosen nurse\nat the critical moment. In finding a way out of this dilemma a\npatient must be guided by her means and the location of her home.\nThose who can afford it will not hesitate to employ a nurse from one\nto two weeks in advance of the expected date of confinement; and for\nthose who live where nurses cannot be procured quickly, a similar\ncourse is recommended. But persons of only moderate resources, living\nin a city where, in an emergency, a substitute can be gotten from the\nlocal \"Nurses' Directory,\" will find it convenient to engage the\nnurse from the calculated date. The substitute will remain with the\npatient until the arrival of the nurse originally engaged.\n\nOccasionally, it may happen that a patient will prefer to keep the\nsubstitute. Such a course, however, would be unjust to the nurse who\nwas first selected, unless she could immediately secure other work.\nShe has reserved a definite period of her time for the patient, and\nprobably has declined work which seemed likely to conflict with the\nengagement already made. She is fairly entitled, therefore, to assume\ncharge of the case, and the patient who refuses to make the change is\nobligated to pay her according to the terms of the agreement.\n\nHow long will a nurse be needed after the child is born? The answer\nto this question may be altered by so many circumstances that a hard\nand fast rule cannot be given. Before the advent of \"Trained Nurses,\"\nobstetrical patients were cared for by \"Monthly Nurses,\" so called\nbecause they remained one month with their patients. It is, likewise,\ncustomary to keep the trained nurse four weeks after the birth; but\nwhenever possible it would be well to retain her six weeks, since\nthis period elapses before the mother has entirely regained her\nnormal physical condition. Those who can afford to keep a trained\nnurse six months or a year are exceptional, but very fortunate.\n\nSomeone may feel that the suggestions I have made are not suitable to\nher case. Very likely they may not be; to cover all the possibilities\ncould scarcely be expected, for every case has its problems and\npeculiarities. After consultation with her physician each patient\nwill decide what is particularly advisable for her. Nevertheless, I\nwould emphasize the importance of securing a competent nurse and\nretaining her for at least four weeks. Even with those who must guard\ntheir expense account the truest economy will lie in such a course.\nWhenever lack of resources seems likely to prevent this arrangement,\nthe patient who is looking to her best interests should enter a\nhospital where excellent care can be provided at a cost within her\nmeans.\n\nDESIRABLE QUALITIES IN THE NURSE.--It is rarely advisable to select\nas nurse a member of the family or an intimate friend. Some of the\nmotives governing such a course--sentiment, mutual devotion, and the\ndesire to be humored--are inconsistent with the best kind of nursing.\nIf the nurse knows the patient intimately, undue anxiety may\ninterfere with her judgment; thoroughness in routine duties may be\nhindered by mistaken consideration for the patient; and in an\nemergency sympathy rather than reason may guide her. A successful\nnurse must satisfy at least two requirements; she must be capable\nprofessionally and also personally agreeable to her patient. Some\nregard advanced years as essential to the first of these\nqualifications, but this does not necessarily hold good.\n\nThe personal qualities generally welcome in a nurse are neatness,\nthoughtfulness, a sympathetic nature, an even disposition, and a\ncheerful view of life. Since a short interview is insufficient for\ntaking the measure of a nurse, patients usually rely upon the opinion\nof someone else in selecting her. The judgment of her former patients\nis frequently prejudiced in one direction or the other, and such an\nestimate must always be accepted with caution. Much the most\ntrustworthy method is to allow the physician to select her. He will\nknow nurses who possess the requisite qualities, and certainly he is\nmost competent to judge their professional attainments. If the choice\nof a nurse be left to the doctor, the two are sure to work\nharmoniously, and the patient will benefit by their cooperation.\nOtherwise she may suffer because of their dissensions, for, if the\ndoctor is accustomed to one procedure and the nurse to another,\nmisunderstandings may occur, although both methods yield equally good\nresults. Whenever he does not select her, she should be asked to\nconfer with him long before the case is due. Obviously, a physician\ncannot be held responsible for a nurse's ability unless he is\nacquainted with her training and methods of work.\n\nIn an effort to economize, many are inclined to employ \"half-trained\"\nor \"practical nurses.\" When the confinement is not the first and\nthere is no reason to anticipate any irregularity during labor or\nthereafter, I can see no vital objection to such an arrangement. It\nis of the first importance, however, to be assured that the\n\"practical nurse\" is neat and appreciates the necessity of keeping\neverything about the patient scrupulously clean. But competent nurses\nwho charge less than the customary fee will be hard to find. The\nrecommendations which these women receive are apt to be even more\nmisleading than in the case of trained nurses, because more is\nexpected of the latter. My experience has taught me that patients\nform particularly unreliable opinions of practical nurses, and I have\nfrequently witnessed incompetence in such women which was overlooked\nby the patient.\n\nA low-priced nurse is seldom a cheap one, as her shortcomings may be\nreflected in the health of the mother or the infant long after she\nhas left the case. Especially when the baby is the first, the mother\nwill depend upon the nurse for instruction which should be both sound\nand thorough. The principles taught her will be put into practice and\nutilized for many months, playing a vital part in the training of the\ninfant. It becomes essential, therefore, to secure a nurse who will\ngive the baby a good start, and instruct the mother along right\nlines. Perhaps this is less needful if the mother has learned her\nlesson from previous experiences. But even then a good nurse relieves\nher of responsibility and materially assists her to a quick and\nlasting convalescence. In the end the most proficient nurses are the\nleast expensive.\n\nTHE PRELIMINARY VISITS OF THE NURSE.--Many of the precautions which\nsafeguard a confinement should be considered by the patient and the\nnurse together. The character and quantity of the supplies, the\nchoice of a room for delivery and subsequent convalescence, the\nproper clothing for the infant--all these are problems which may be\nsolved most satisfactorily in the light of the nurse's experience and\nthe resources at hand. Two visits are usually sufficient to arrange\nthese details. An interview early in pregnancy, soon after the nurse\nhas been selected, provides an opportunity to lay plans and\nespecially to review the list of articles needed at delivery. Such\narticles as are already in the house may be checked off; the others\nmay be procured at leisure. Eight to ten weeks before the expected\ndate of the confinement the nurse should pay a second visit and\nshould inspect the supplies to see that they are complete. Certain\narticles which I shall indicate must be sterilized. As this procedure\nis more reliable when carried out by an experienced person it will be\nconvenient to have all the dressings finished by the time of the\nnurse's second visit, in order that she may sterilize them.\n\nThe question may arise as to whether the nurse shall come to the\npatient upon the date for which she has been engaged or shall wait\nuntil summoned. From the physician's standpoint it is often more\nacceptable to have the nurse in the house a few days before the\nconfinement, though some patients strongly object to this. Provided\nthe nurse may be got quickly at any time of day or night, there can\nbe no objection to leaving the decision to the patient herself.\n\nTHE NECESSARY SUPPLIES FOR CONFINEMENT.--As to just what a\nconfinement outfit should contain physicians differ to some extent;\nbut this disagreement pertains rather to luxuries than essentials. In\nthe lists here suggested nothing essential has been omitted, although\neconomy, as far as is consistent with good judgment, has been kept in\nmind. Any article not included in my list which the doctor or nurse\nin attendance recommends may be noted in the space for memoranda.\n\nSome patients prefer to take no part in preparing the supplies for\nconfinement. Indeed, the demand for a ready-made confinement outfit\nhas become large enough to lead several firms to put them upon the\nmarket. These outfits differ in completeness and vary in price from a\nfew dollars up to fifty. The majority of patients, however, still\nattend to such details themselves, and will find a list of the\nneedful supplies convenient.\n\n_Make-up and Sterilize_:\n  7 Dozen Sanitary Pads.\n  2 Sanitary Belts.\n  2 Delivery Pads.\n  5 Dozen Gauze Sponges.\n  2 Dozen Gauze Squares.\n  4 Dozen Cotton Pledgets.\n  2 Sheets.\n  Bobbin for tying the Cord.\n  A Pair of Obstetrical Leggins.\n  A Dozen and a Half Towels (Diapers).\n\n_Obtain from the Druggist_:\n  100 Bichlorid of Mercury Tablets.\n  100 grams Chloroform.\n  4 ounces Powdered Boric Acid.\n  4 ounces Tincture Green Soap.\n  1 pint Grain Alcohol.\n  A small jar of White Vaselin.\n  A cake of Castile Soap.\n  A two-ounce Medicine Glass.\n  A Medicine Dropper.\n  A bent glass Drinking Tube.\n\n_The following articles should be in the house, ready for use._\n\n  An ample supply of Towels, Sheets, and Gowns.\n\n  A new Hand-Brush; the cheap variety with wooden back and stiff\n  bristles is preferable.\n\n  Two slop Jars or enamel Buckets with Covers.\n\n  A two-quart Fountain Syringe; an old one may be substituted provided\n  it has been thoroughly boiled.\n\n  Three Basins and a one-quart Pitcher of agate or enamel-ware.\n\n  A Douche-Pan; the \"perfection Bed-Pan\" is preferable.\n\n  Two pieces of Rubber-Sheeting are required, one large enough to cover\n  the mattress of a single bed (2 x 1-1/2 yds.), the other smaller (1 x\n  3/4 yd.). Should this be too expensive, the best substitute is white\n  table oil-cloth.\n\nThe nurse will explain how the various surgical dressings are made,\nbut, as the patient may forget some of the directions, all the\ndetails will be given here. At least three to four pounds of\nabsorbent cotton will be used in the dressings. To make the pads\nentirely of absorbent cotton is very expensive. The cheaper cotton-\nbatting is therefore employed to give them body, and they are faced\nonly upon one side with the absorbent material. Furthermore, the\nrolls of absorbent cotton, as purchased, may be separated into three\nor four layers, one of which is thick enough for the facing. About\nsix rolls of the batting should be purchased.\n\nSurgical gauze, which tradespeople sometimes call dairy-cloth, is the\nmost suitable material for covering the pads. Bleached cheese cloth\nwill answer the same purpose, but it is more expensive and rather\nheavy. Approximately thirty-five yards of the gauze, which comes in a\nthirty-six-inch width, will be needed. When the supplies are\nfinished, they are wrapped in separate bundles and sterilized. Old\nmuslin or some of the diapers are generally used for covers.\n\n_The sanitary pads_, also called vulval or perineal pads, absorb\nthe discharge which always occurs after delivery. They are made of\nabsorbent cotton and cotton-batting covered with gauze; a convenient\nsize is ten inches long and three to four inches wide. Their\nthickness is approximately an inch, one-third of which is composed of\nabsorbent cotton.\n\n_The sanitary belt_ is used to hold these pads in place. Very\nsatisfactory ones are made of two strips of unbleached muslin, three\ninches wide. The first of these must be long enough to reach around\nthe waist; the second, which passes over the pad, is somewhat shorter\nand has two parallel slits in one end; through which the waist-band\npasses at the back; the three free ends are pinned together in front.\n\n_The delivery pads_ are made of the same materials as the\nsanitary pads; preferably a yard square and four inches thick. A\nrather heavy top-layer of absorbent cotton must be used in them, and\nthey should be quilted or tacked at several points to prevent\nslipping. A rubber pad is ill adapted for use during delivery. Some\nabsorbent material made into proper shape proves much more\nsatisfactory since it can be thoroughly sterilized and can be thrown\naway after it has been used.\n\nI am told that cotton-waste is a good substitute for absorbent cotton\nin the delivery pads. It is inexpensive, and will be rendered capable\nof absorbing fluids after it has been boiled in washing soda and\ndried in the sun. Each delivery pad should be separately wrapped and\nsterilized.\n\n_Gauze sponges_ will be needed by the doctor; about five dozen\nshould be prepared. The gauze is cut in eighteen-inch squares.\nOpposite edges are folded toward one another, about two inches being\nlapped each time; this finally yields a seven or eight-ply strip,\nwhich is wrapped into appropriate shape about two fingers. The\nravelled ends are then tucked into the roll. It is most satisfactory\nto divide the sponges and sterilize them in two bundles.\n\nSmall pieces of gauze about two inches square will also be needed in\ncaring for the baby's eyes and mouth. Several dozen should be cut,\nand they may all be sterilized together.\n\n_Cotton pledgets_ are simply bits of absorbent cotton the size\nof a hen's egg, the rough edges of which have been twisted together.\nA small pillow-case full of them ought to be made up and sterilized.\n\n_Obstetrical leggins_ are preferably made of canton flannel;\nthey are cut to fit loosely and should reach the hip. If they are\nprepared so as to extend to the waist at the sides, they may be held\nin place by a waistband, and in this way will prevent unnecessary\nexposure without interfering with the doctor. They should be\nsterilized.\n\n_Towels_, if used at all, should be without fringe. It is\neconomical not to employ them, but to use diapers in their place.\nThree packages, each containing six diapers, should be sterilized.\n\n_Sterilized sheets_ are often useful at the delivery; more than\ntwo are never needed. They should be wrapped separately for the\nsterilization.\n\n_Sterilized bobbin_ is generally used for tying the cord.\nSeveral pieces are cut in nine-inch lengths and sterilized in a\nsingle package.\n\n_A dressing for the cord_ will be required, but there is no\nnecessity for preparing a special one. It is generally satisfactory\nto wrap the cord in one of the sterile gauze sponges which has been\npreviously soaked in alcohol.\n\nSeveral methods of drying up the cord give equally good results, and\nit is usually a good plan to allow the nurse to dress it as she\nwishes, since the employment of a method with which she is familiar\nwill more likely insure a satisfactory result in her hands. A\ndressing popular with many nurses is prepared as follows: In a piece\nof muslin four inches square cut a small circular opening; double the\nlinen and dust boric acid between the folds. If this method is\npreferred, several of the dressings should be prepared and sterilized\ntogether.\n\nTHE BABY'S OUTFIT.--Preparations for the infant may be thorough\nwithout being elaborate. Instinctively, the prospective mother leans\ntoward extravagance in fitting out her baby's wardrobe, and easily\nslips into the error of providing too much. Time and energy are\nfrequently devoted to an extensive wardrobe which the infant quickly\noutgrows; in consequence many articles must be made over before they\nare used. Even with modest resources a prospective mother can acquire\neverything the baby really needs.\n\nA very sensible plan, in my judgment, is to prepare what will be\nwanted during the first two months; subsequently, articles may be\nmade or bought as they are needed. Accordingly, the quantity of\nwearing apparel and the nursery supplies I have suggested pertain\nonly to the early weeks of infant life. Although no essential has\nbeen omitted, the outline is plain and economical.\n\nAt present, outfitters supply a variety of ready-made, garments for\nthe infant and conveniences for the nursery; in many of them notable\ningenuity is displayed which aims at the child's comfort or the\nsaving of labor to the mother. Catalogs of these articles, which are\noften expensive, are furnished by dealers.\n\nIn preparing clothing for the new-born, several principles must be\nkept in mind. The first is that the garments must be warm without\nbeing unduly heavy; and another that they should be roomy, permitting\nperfect freedom of motion. A third no less important principle is\nsimplicity. Adornment of the clothing gratifies the mother, but does\nnot serve a single useful purpose. The lists which follow include all\nthat is necessary for the young infant; they will also serve as a\nbasis for elaboration if a more lavish outfit is desired.\n\n_Necessary Clothing_.\n  4 Abdominal Flannel Bands.\n  3 Undershirts.\n  4 flannel Skirts.\n  4 Night Gowns.\n  12 White Slips.\n  3 Knit Bands.\n  4 Dozen Diapers.\n  Cloak and Cap.\n\n_Nursery Equipment_.\n  An old Blanket.\n  Assorted Safety Pins.\n  Soft Damask Towels.\n  Wash Cloths.\n  Hot-Water Bag with Canton Flannel Covers.\n  Talcum Powder.\n  Olive Oil.\n  Bassinet.\n\n_Additional Articles; Convenient but Not Essential_.\n  Rubber Bathtub.\n  Rubber Bath-Apron.\n  Flannel Apron.\n  Bath Thermometer.\n  Bath Hamper.\n  Quilted Mattress Covering.\n  Baby Scales.\n  Screen.\n  Low Chair without Arms.\n  Drying Frames.\n\nSTERILIZATION.--Now and again, those who follow very rigid rules to\navoid infection during childbirth are criticized for their pains. The\ngeneral public has not yet grasped the true relation of bacteria to\nthis condition; a relation which, indeed, first became clear to\nmedical men within comparatively recent years. The development of our\nknowledge of the nature of infection forms one of the most\nentertaining chapters in obstetrics, and provides a simple way of\nshowing the genuine need of preventive measures. Several observant\nphysicians had previously suspected the character of \"child-bed\nfever\" (as infection of the mother was once called), but convincing\nproof of its contagious nature was not forthcoming until the middle\nof the nineteenth century, when signal facts were pointed out by\nthree men, each working independently, though all came to similar\nconclusions. The evidence they gathered should have left no one\ndoubtful that the disease is contagious, and largely preventable. On\nthe contrary, bitter opposition was encountered for the time, and\nonly within the last two decades has their teaching found wide\npractical application.\n\nIn 1843 Oliver Wendell Holmes published the paper on \"The\nContagiousness of Puerperal Fever,\" which is now preserved in his\nvolume of \"Medical Essays.\" Physicians were startled to be frankly\ntold the responsibility they assumed if they neglected the truth\ntaught by epidemics of this disease. \"The dark obituary calendar\"\nwhich marked the progress of these epidemics clearly indicated that\n\"the disease is so far contagious as to be frequently carried from\npatient to patient by physicians and nurses.\" A violent controversy\nfollowed this arraignment, and, consequently, the preventive measures\nwhich Holmes so convincingly urged were not adopted as promptly as\nthey should have been. The full justice of his conclusions has since\nbeen universally admitted, and medical men now find it difficult to\nunderstand how anyone could have taken issue with the sentiment which\nhe expressed. \"For my part,\" Holmes said, \"I had rather rescue one\nmother from being poisoned by her attendant than claim to have saved\nforty out of fifty patients to whom I had carried the disease.\"\n\nBut the most important early observations upon child-bed fever were\nmade in 1847 by a young Hungarian, Semmelweiss, while he was an\nassistant in the large Lying-in Hospital in Vienna. In thoroughness,\npower of conviction, and practical value his work was masterful. It\nis no exaggeration to regard his observations as the rock upon which\nantiseptic surgery, the glory of the nineteenth century, was built.\n\nSemmelweiss had been seeking an explanation of the dreadful scourge,\nand his mind was ready for the reception of the truth when it was\nrevealed through the death of one of his colleagues. This physician\ninjured his finger accidentally in performing an autopsy upon a\npatient who had died from child-bed fever. And the condition\ndisclosed by examination of his body after death was identical with\nthat found in cases of child-bed fever. Here then was the clew; the\ndisease was contagious. Semmelweiss was ignorant of Holmes' views;\nwhat had happened before his eyes suggested to him that the disease\nwas due to a poison which could be conveyed from one person to\nanother. Moreover, his interest and his power of insight led to\nfurther comparison. Clearly, the open wound on the physician's finger\nhad been the portal through which the poison entered; but where was\nthere a similar portal in obstetrical patients? The answer was plain.\nThe birth-canal at the time of delivery is always an open wound.\nThere the poison entered, and child-bed fever was a wound infection!\n\nSeveral years later Tarnier, who was to become an eminent\nobstetrician, but was then a student in Paris, chose the diseases of\nthe lying-in period as the subject for his graduating thesis. He was\nunacquainted with the work either of Holmes or of Semmelweiss, and\napproached the problem from still another standpoint, drawing\nattention to the much higher deathrate among women delivered amid\nunsanitary surroundings. Tarnier also considered that the disease was\na form of poisoning, that it was contagious, and that measures should\nbe instituted to protect patients against it.\n\nOf these pioneers, by far the greatest credit is due Semmelweiss, who\ndevoted his life to the problem, although his opinions continually\nmet with scepticism and even ridicule. More convincing proof than he\ncould furnish was demanded before his contemporaries would believe\nthat child-bed fever was due to lack of precaution. Fortunately the\nevidence was soon produced. In 1880, Pasteur obtained bacteria from\nthe organs which had been infected, and was able to grow the bacteria\nin his laboratory; thus the ultimate cause of the disease became\nfirmly established. With the harmful agents in their hands, Pasteur\nand his followers were enabled to study their characteristics and to\nrecommend means of destroying them.\n\nMuch as we must regret that the warnings of Holmes and of Tarnier\npassed unheeded; lamentable as may be the blindness of the generation\nof Semmelweiss to the truths revealed by his research, it is not\nsurprising that such radical teaching met with a hostile reception.\nAs we measure time in retrospect from the vantage ground of to-day,\nthe three to four decades required for full acceptance of their\nrevolutionary doctrines seem a brief span. Antiseptic methods would\nnot have prevailed so quickly as they did, had not the same epoch\nwhich gave us a Pasteur also given a surgeon with a receptive mind,\nready to seize and apply the discoveries of the French genius. This\nwas the great service of Joseph Lister. Impressed with Pasteur's\nstudies on fermentation, Lister saw an analogy between this process\nand the putrefaction of wounds, a condition which he was eager to\nprevent. He had reason to believe that carbolic acid would check\ndecomposition, and he employed a weak solution of it in the treatment\nof wounds; later he devised a \"carbolic spray,\" by means of which\nwhen his operations were performed the atmosphere round about might\nbe sterilized.\n\nIt is but a short step from antiseptic operations to our own era of\naseptic surgery, and that a step in the direction of simplicity. Now\nwe know that the sterilization of the air is rarely necessary and\nhave dispensed with Lister's elaborate apparatus. Furthermore, and of\nfar greater moment, experience has taught that the destruction of\nbacteria before they have opportunity to come in contact with the\nwound is more effective than efforts to kill them as they approach or\nafter they have invaded the tissues. Initial freedom from bacteria is\nthe ideal of asepsis; to secure it, the modern surgeon is ever\nwatchful of the cleanliness of his hands, his instruments, his\ndressings, and of the site of operation or whatever may come near it.\n\nThe importance of the changes wrought by the adoption of aseptic\nmethods requires no emphasis, for the marvels of modern surgery are\neven more impressive to laymen than to the medical profession.\nEverybody now understands that strict cleanliness is indispensable to\nthe success of a surgical operation. But the general public has not\nfully awakened to the same profound necessity in connection with\nchildbirth, although it was child-bed fever that called forth the\nobservations and experiments upon which modern surgical technique\nrests.\n\nAlthough most obstetrical patients appreciate the fact that there is\nan advantage in sterilized dressings and sanitary surroundings, few\nrealize the risk they run without them. One must know the mournful\nhistory of the past to be adequately impressed with that danger, for\nwe no longer see the epidemics of childbed fever which formerly swept\nover communities, sacrificing ten of every hundred women as they\nbecame mothers. Precaution is no less necessary on that account; the\nscourge would be rampant again if the reins were loosened.\n\nMost instances of puerperal infection are, it is true, referable to\nlack of care. Nevertheless, the complication develops now and then\nwhere all precautions have been conscientiously observed. Under such\nconditions the infection will in all likelihood be a mild one, and a\ntedious convalescence usually proves its most disagreeable feature.\nSuch stringent preventive measures as are now practiced in many\nhospitals have reduced the frequency of infections to the point where\nonly one fatal case, or even less, occurs in a thousand deliveries.\nThese rare cases remind us that vigilance must never be relaxed, and\nthat patients who are confined at home require just as much care as\nthose in hospitals, where conditions are the best to prevent\ninfection and the complications, which follow.\n\nThe first essential toward the avoidance of infection in obstetrical\ncases is clean dressings. Naturally, these should be clean to the\nsight, but it is in invisible dirt that serious danger lurks;\nbacteria are the causative agents of this disease. Experiments have\ntaught the bacteriologist that disease-producing organisms are killed\nin half an hour when subjected to a high atmospheric pressure and the\ntemperature of steam. Special apparatus has been constructed for\ncarrying out the procedure. It is unnecessary for our purposes,\nhowever, since the essential conditions may be secured, though with\nless convenience, in any kitchen. If a prospective mother finds it\nawkward to do the sterilizing at home, and her nurse is unable to\ntake charge of the matter, she may arrange with a local hospital or\nthe nearest nurses' directory to sterilize her dressings. Yet a very\nlittle ingenuity suffices to do the work at home with perfect\nsatisfaction. Installments of the smaller bundles may be sterilized\nin a galvanized bucket. To do this place an inverted bowl, with a\ndepth of three to four inches, at the bottom, and pour in water until\nthe bowl is almost covered. A breakfast plate rests on the bowl, and\nupon this the dressings are stacked; a second larger plate which fits\nthe top of the bucket is utilized as a lid to close in the\nsterilizing chamber. This will not accommodate the larger packages; a\nmore satisfactory method for all of them is to use a wash-boiler in\nwhich has been swung a muslin hammock.\n\nTo arrange the latter form of home sterilizer, cut an oblong piece of\nunbleached muslin large enough to sink far down into the boiler and\nrun a drawing-string of stout cord about the edge. Cover the bottom\nof the boiler with several inches of water; tie the hammock in place,\npassing the cord beneath the handles of the boiler to hold the muslin\nsecurely. Pack in the dressings, which have been wrapped in\nappropriate bundles; put the lid in place, thus closing the\nsterilizing chamber, and leave the dressings exposed to the steam for\nat least half an hour. After the operation has been completed, the\nbundles are taken out of the boiler and allowed to dry in the air.\nThey must not be opened until the occasion for which the supplies\nwere prepared arrives; awaiting this event, they are laid away in a\nconvenient closet or drawer.\n\nA word of caution may be added concerning a method of sterilization\nemployed at home more frequently, perhaps, than any other. According\nto this procedure, the supplies are wrapped in paper, thrust into a\nhot oven, and left there until the paper is scorched. From the\nstandpoint of economy as well as of thoroughness, this method is\nlikely to prove unsatisfactory. Frequently, the dressings themselves\nare scorched; I have known patients to ruin several installments of\ntheir supplies in this way. Moreover, dry heat is not so trustworthy\nas steam for sterilizing purposes.\n\nJudicious management means the preparation of the supplies necessary\nfor confinement before turning to the selection of the infant's\noutfit. Ordinarily, both these tasks should be finished by the end of\nthe eighth month, and final arrangements for the approaching delivery\nwill then claim attention. If the patient expects to remain at home,\nshe must decide which is the best room to occupy; she will wonder how\nit ought to be equipped, and she will be anxious to learn what\npersonal preparations are advisable at the beginning of labor.\n\nIntelligent answers to these questions are important. A patient\nshould request the physician to criticize her plans when he pays the\npreliminary visit four to five weeks prior to the expected date of\nconfinement. If she has acted unwisely in any respect, he will point\nit out, and may suggest changes which will enable her to employ to\nthe best advantage the resources at hand.\n\nTHE CHOICE AND ARRANGEMENT OF A ROOM.--An old-fashioned custom, which\nrelegated obstetrical patients to the most secluded part of the\nhouse, with little regard for comfort and still less for hygiene, has\nnow few, if any, adherents. There is an advantage, to be sure, in\nhaving a quiet room; but this qualification may be secured in a room\nwell located with regard to other essentials. Selection of a suitable\nroom is not a trivial point. In most cases, since patients ordinarily\nremain for convalescence in the same room in which the infant is\nborn, the chamber must serve a two-fold purpose. A number of\nrequirements, therefore, must be met, and they must all be kept in\nmind when the room is chosen.\n\nWe have seen that the act of birth, natural as it is, may have a very\nunnatural sequel if precautions against infection are treated\nlightly. It is proper, therefore, that the delivery-room should be as\nclean as care can make it. Such radical measures as may be employed\nin sterilizing the dressings are here out of the question; if\npossible, they would be absurd. Infection usually develops because\nharmful bacteria come in contact with the patient. For that reason,\nan infection is more likely to be communicated by the dressings than\nby articles about the room, which only become a source of danger when\nthe dirt upon them is transferred by an attendant.\n\nAn acceptable delivery-room may be arranged in any home; it is by no\nmeans necessary to duplicate the equipment of a modern hospital. To\nchoose a room convenient to the bathroom will be found advantageous\nnot only at the time of birth but throughout the lying-in period. The\nfurnishing should be simple and scrupulously clean; indeed, it is\nimprobable that one of these good points can be secured without the\nother. Furthermore, the preparation of the room should be completed\nwell in advance of the date of confinement.\n\nA large collection of furniture interferes with the nursing, and also\nincreases the difficulty of keeping the room free of dust. It is\nsound advice, therefore, to remove everything which will not serve\nsome good purpose during the delivery. Should any article be wanted\nlater, it can be brought back to its accustomed place. The furniture\nmay be conveniently limited to a bed, a bureau, a washstand, a table,\nand several chairs, one of them a large, comfortable rocker, which\nwill prove invaluable during the early part of labor.\n\nTo approach perfect conditions, bric-a-brac, needless hangings, and\neverything that might collect dust should be temporarily removed. A\nprofusion of pictures does not accord with the best sanitation of a\nroom devoted to the treatment of obstetrical patients; those which\nare to be left upon the wall ought to be taken down and wiped\ncarefully with a damp cloth. Other desirable preparations would be\ninstinctively undertaken by the modern housekeeper, and it may seem\npresumption to mention that the room itself ought to be subjected to\nmost thorough cleaning. It is well to leave the floor bare or merely\ncovered with freshly cleaned rugs. Carpeting is difficult to protect\nagainst soiling and is not sanitary. If left down, the carpet should\nbe covered with some suitable material, firmly stretched and tacked\nin place.\n\nWe know that the air in most households does not contain disease-\nproducing bacteria; but the presence of any contagious disease\nmaterially alters the situation, and may imperil the convalescence of\nan obstetrical patient. Preferably, one should never select a room in\nwhich there has lately been sickness, and under no circumstances may\nsuch a room be used until carefully fumigated. The more conspicuous\ndiseases which for at least several months absolutely disqualify an\napartment for obstetrical purposes are diphtheria, pneumonia,\npleurisy, erysipelas, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, tuberculosis of\nall varieties, and every sort of discharging sore.\n\nWhen possible, two adjoining rooms should be given over to the mother\nand the infant; if this is impracticable, the single room should be\nlarge, easily ventilated, well lighted, and heated in such a way as\nto permit a change of temperature without difficulty. All these\nfeatures help to make convalescence comfortable and free from petty\nannoyances. A room which has a southern or eastern exposure proves\ngrateful for those who must remain indoors; frequently, this will be\nbeyond reach, but a room getting the sun's rays directly during part\nof the day will always be available, and the selection should be made\nwith that requirement in mind. At the time of birth and for the first\nfew days which follow, a patient may not appreciate this feature;\nultimately she will understand the need of sunlight better than the\nneed for the more technical, and therefore the more impressive,\npreparations.\n\nTHE BED.--Now that housekeepers recognize how easily such furniture\ncan be kept clean, few homes are without a brass or an iron bedstead;\nthey are equally sanitary. Undoubtedly, this kind of bedstead\nfulfills the needs of an obstetrical patient much better than any\nother; and, if at hand, it should be used. The single bedstead is the\nmost acceptable, and the mattress ought to be at least twenty inches\nabove the floor. A low, wide bed interferes with proper management of\nthe delivery and later handicaps the nurse in taking care of the\npatient. Wooden blocks may be used to raise a bed which otherwise\nwould be too low. It is well worth while to provide them if one\ndesires good nursing, for no attendant can do her best when she must\ncontinuously bend over a very low bed.\n\nThe location of the bed at the time of delivery is not an unimportant\nmatter; it must always be placed so that the brightest possible light\nwill shine over the foot. Since birth often occurs at night, one\nshould make certain that the artificial lighting of the room is good,\nand place the bed most advantageously in reference to it; at the same\ntime the necessity of a good light from the windows, when delivery\noccurs during the day, should not be forgotten. The head of the bed\nmay be placed against the wall, but both sides must remain freely\naccessible not only at the time of delivery but also throughout the\nlying-in period.\n\nA smooth, firm mattress, made in one piece, should be provided. One\nwhich has been used several years and possibly worn in a hollow will\nrequire renovation to be made comfortable. A feather bed should not\nbe used under any circumstances. The mattress must be protected; and\nprotection is best secured by means of a large piece of rubber\nsheeting. The regulation household sheet covering the rubber should\nbe tucked well under the mattress at the ends and sides; in that way\nthe rubber sheeting will be held firmly. Since the part of the bed\nwhere the hips rest will be most exposed to soiling, the protection\nof this area is usually reinforced by a \"draw sheet.\" To arrange\nthis, a cotton sheet is doubled so as to make a strip about one yard\nwide and two yards long; the smaller piece of rubber sheeting is laid\nbetween the folds. The draw sheet will reach from the middle of the\nback to the knees; its ends should be tucked under the sides of the\nmattress, to which it is fastened by means of large safety pins.\nAfter delivery, the draw sheet may be removed without disturbing the\nmother, who will thus be assured a clean, dry, and comfortable bed.\n\nThe bed-clothes covering the patient during labor will vary with the\nseason of the year, but should always be light; in summer a single\nsheet will suffice, and in winter a blanket will likely be needed.\nFor sanitary reasons, a freshly laundered sheet should also be placed\noutside the blanket until the delivery has been completed; later, it\nmay be replaced with a light spread. Two pillows will be needed, and\nit is very convenient to have one of hair, the other of feathers.\nWhile there is no necessity for sterilizing the bed-clothes, it is\nadvisable to use linen which has been recently laundered and kept\nwell protected from dust. Among the poor, infection from soiled bed-\nlinen is not uncommon.\n\nTHE PRELIMINARY VISIT OF THE DOCTOR.--No teaching of medical science\nhas been given greater prominence of late than the principle of\nprevention. In obstetrics it finds a particularly wide field of\napplication, and its practice is responsible for removing many of the\nformer terrors of childbirth. We have just learned that preventive\nmeasures effectually reduce the frequency of puerperal infection, and\nin an earlier chapter we saw the value of routine examination of the\nurine as a means of anticipating other complications. Moreover, the\nbenefit of promptly reporting to the physician anything that does not\nseem to be as it should has been urged constantly, for in this way is\nafforded the earliest opportunity to treat complications. Similarly a\nvisit from the doctor about four weeks before the expected date of\nconfinement is indispensable to skillful management of the delivery;\nneglect of this precaution is sometimes responsible for bad results.\n\nAt this visit the physician not only becomes familiar with the\ngeneral health of his patient, but he also notes certain facts which\nwill have a direct bearing upon the course of labor. By means of a\nfew simple measurements he may accurately determine the character of\nthe pelvis, the bony structure through which the fetus passes. When\nthey are compared with what we know as the normal measurements, a\nvery good idea is gained as to whether the birth-canal will present\nany obstacle to the passage of the child; and, if it will, there is\nopportunity to deliberate what treatment may be necessary. Since\nanother factor in the problem, namely, the size of the child, cannot\nbe accurately predicted, occasionally the physician may hesitate to\nexpress as definite an opinion as the patient may wish. Nevertheless,\nthough it may be impossible to learn every detail, the available\ninformation well repays the time and trouble expended. In nine out of\nten cases nothing whatever is found out of the way; the result is an\nassurance which always justifies the examination.\n\nDuring this examination the position of the child is also\nascertained. By means of a series of painless manipulations through\nthe abdominal wall of the mother, the head, the body, and the\nextremities of the child may be mapped out, and the conclusions\nverified by locating the fetal heart-sounds. In this regard, also,\nthe physician usually finds normal conditions. The most favorable\npresentation, that in which the head is the part to be born first,\noccurs in ninety-seven of every hundred cases. When less favorable\nconditions are recognized, they may frequently be corrected at once;\nbut should that prove impossible, with foreknowledge of the\npresentation, the physician will be more competent to conduct the\ndelivery.\n\nWith a clear understanding of the character and value of the\ninformation gathered at the preliminary examination, patients are not\nlikely to refuse it. If they do, the risks should be fully explained\nto them. Some physicians decline to assume the responsibility of a\npatient who will not permit these observations. Such a decision is\nrarely necessary, for in my experience the patient's consent has\nnever been difficult to obtain. Many women now regard the visit as\npart of the routine attention, and inquire when it will be made.\n\nThe appropriate time for this examination, as I have indicated, is\napproximately one month prior to the calculated date of confinement.\nBefore this period, we have no assurance that the presentation which\nis found will continue until the time of birth. The fetus frequently\nalters its position as long as it is not large enough to fill out the\ncavity of the womb, consequently it is only during the last month of\npregnancy that the final presentation can be determined. But to defer\nthe examination after the period I have specified is unsafe since we\nlack an exact method of fixing the day of confinement, and too long a\ndelay might render a preliminary examination impossible.\n\nAside from its relation to the observations just outlined, the\npreliminary visit provides an opportunity for the physician to\ncriticize the preparations which have been made, and for the patient\nto inquire about the personal preparation advisable at the beginning\nof labor. She will also learn the signs which indicate that labor has\nbegun and will be told what to do when they appear. Although\nphysicians may not agree in all these directions, there can be no\ndifference of opinion relative to the essential points. At least, the\nrules given here will serve to bring the patient and the doctor to a\ndefinite understanding as to the course he desires her to follow.\n\nWHEN TO CALL THE DOCTOR.--During the last two or three weeks of\npregnancy not a few patients are more comfortable than they have been\nfor several months. About this time the womb usually drops somewhat\nand relieves the pressure which has interfered with breathing. These\nchanges, however, do not promote comfort in every direction; more\nfreedom for the organs of the chest means compression of the\nstructures below the womb; consequently, the inclination to empty the\nbladder and for the bowels to move becomes more frequent. Patients\ncomplain also of cramps in the legs and experience difficulty on\nwalking. This order of events enables some women to recognize the\napproach of delivery. Of course there is other evidence when labor\nactually begins. Its onset may be indicated in one of three ways,\nnamely, by periodic pains, by a gush of water from the vagina, or by\na discharge of blood as though the patient were taken unwell. Each of\nthese unmistakable signs is a sufficient reason for notifying the\ndoctor.\n\nAt the onset of labor, dragging pains are usually felt at the back,\nbut sometimes in the lower part of the abdomen. The rhythm with which\nthey come and go identifies them more certainly than any other\nfeature, though this indication is not entirely reliable, for\nintestinal colic also causes rhythmical pain. At first the uterine\ncontractions which occasion the discomfort are weak and appear at\nlong intervals. Gradually they become stronger and closer together.\nWhen the interval between them has been shortened to half an hour or\nless their significance is fairly certain, provided the abdomen\nbecomes tense and hard with each pain, remaining comparatively soft\nbetween them.\n\nWhen contractions begin during the day or early evening, the\nphysician will be glad to have immediate notification in order that\nhe may arrange his appointments and thus be free to attend the\npatient when she needs his services. On the other hand, if they begin\nbetween 11 P.M. and 7 A.M. the nurse, who will always be summoned\nwith the very first warning, should be allowed to decide when the\ndoctor is to be called. Unless other instructions have been given,\nshe will usually wait until the interval between the contractions is\nfive to ten minutes.\n\nUsually the symptoms make it clear that labor has begun, but\noccasionally the greatest difficulty will be experienced in deciding\nwhether the discomfort has not some other origin. Uncertainty may\nprevail not only because of the similar effects of colic, but also\nfrom the fact that uterine contractions do not always have the same\nvalue. Preliminary pains may appear several days, or even weeks,\nbefore the actual onset of labor. Now and then the \"false\" pains\ncease, and after a period of comfort efficient contractions are\nestablished. There is never difficulty in recognizing the latter;\ndoubt always relates to the preliminary pains, which may subside or\nmay pass into the efficient type. We lack a method of foretelling\nwhich turn they will take; developments may be calmly awaited, with\nthe assurance that ample warning will precede the birth.\n\nA slight mucous discharge from the vagina is frequently seen toward\nthe end of pregnancy and may be disregarded, but a gush of watery\nfluid always means that the sac which contains the fetus has\nruptured. Uterine contractions generally follow within a few hours,\nthough in a few instances they will not appear for a number of days.\nUnder any circumstances the event ought to be promptly reported to\nthe doctor. Similarly, he should be notified whenever bleeding from\nthe vagina occurs, since it is important to have him determine its\nsignificance.\n\nAnyone who supposes that patients are more likely to be infected when\ndelivery occurs so quickly that there is not time for the doctor to\narrive overlooks the leading factor in the production of this\ncomplication. Unless harmful bacteria are introduced into the birth-\ncanal and lodge there, infection is impossible. Bacteria never enter\nof their own accord; they are usually carried into the vagina by\nmeans of an examining finger or some other foreign body. Accordingly,\nwith the exception of those instances in which local inflammation\nalready exists, there is no reason to fear infection when delivery\nproceeds so rapidly that internal examinations are not required.\n\nPERSONAL PREPARATIONS.--Ordinarily, if the nurse is not already in\nthe house, she will arrive in time to assist the patient in making\nthe final arrangements for delivery. Should the nurse be delayed, the\npatient herself may make certain preparations to insure personal\ncleanliness, another very important factor in the prevention of\ninfection.\n\nThe presence of hair and the folding of the skin about the outlet to\nthe birth-canal render the disinfection of this area somewhat\ndifficult. It is advisable, therefore, to clip the hair as short as\npossible and, while bathing the whole body, to scrub the region in\nquestion with especial thoroughness. Before the bath an enema of\nsoap-suds should be taken to clear the rectum of material which\notherwise might be expelled during the birth and contaminate the\nfield of delivery. The bath-towels and the gown which are used should\nhave been freshly laundered.\n\nOther especial preparation of the delivery-field will be made later\nby the nurse. But whenever labor progresses so rapidly that neither\nthe nurse nor the doctor arrives before the child is born, such\npreparations as I have indicated will be sufficient, for more minute\nprecautions are unnecessary unless an internal examination must be\nmade.\n\nTHE CARE OF OBSTETRICAL PATIENTS AT THE HOSPITAL.--The majority of\nobstetrical patients are attended at home, and there is no reason why\nthis should not be. Generally it is unfair to urge a woman to go to a\nhospital if she has already passed through a normal confinement and\nthere is no reason to anticipate trouble in the approaching one; on\nthe other hand, if any complication whatever is anticipated, the\npatient should certainly enter a hospital. Furthermore, it frequently\nproves advantageous to do so where the pregnancy is the first, though\nno complication is expected and none develops. The average labor with\nthe first child lasts somewhat longer than with subsequent ones, and\nin consequence there is greater opportunity for the patient's family\nor friends to interfere with the management of the case, which never\nbenefits a patient, and is sometimes a serious handicap. Then again,\nthe cramped apartments, so common in these days, are poorly adapted\nto the treatment of sickness of any sort and should induce many\nobstetrical patients to choose the hospital. There are, besides,\nother features which favor this course, such as economy, convenience,\nand safety. From my own experience, which includes the care of\npatients both at home and at the hospital, I am convinced that, as a\nrule, the latter is much more satisfactory.\n\nMost cities now have institutions which provide a room and all the\nessential care, exclusive of the doctor's services, at approximately\nthe cost of a trained nurse at home; luxuries will naturally add to\nthe expense in hospitals as quickly as elsewhere. If one considers\nthe various items connected with attention at home, such as the\nmaintenance of the nurse and of the patient, the cost of the\nequipment necessary for confinement, the additional household\nlaundry, and the sundry other details, it is clear that hospital\ntreatment becomes distinctly economical. Moreover, the uncertainty of\nthe date of confinement may necessitate paying a nurse for a longer\nor shorter period before the birth. Expense at the hospital, on the\ncontrary, usually begins when the patient enters; and if she lives in\nthe city it is rarely advisable for her to leave home until the\nbeginning of labor. Even aside from the matter of expense some women\nprefer the hospital, since in this way they avoid the technical\npreparations for the birth.\n\nMuch more vital, however, is the care patients receive in the\nhospital, for rigid adherence to surgical cleanliness is exemplified\nin the hospital as it can be nowhere else. Infections rarely develop\nthere. Formerly these accidents were more common in the hospital than\nin the home, but conditions are now reversed and fatalities\npredominate among those delivered in private houses. The modern\ntheory of asepsis has, to be sure, been widely accepted and is\npracticed so far as possible wherever obstetrical patients are\nattended, but only in the hospital can the underlying principles be\napplied with complete thoroughness and persistence. The hospital is\nconstantly alert, whereas in private houses carelessness or\nignorance, or both, often lead to lax technique. As a result,\nstatistical evidence indicates that two to three infections occur\namong those delivered at home for one at the hospital.\n\nIn the event of an emergency during labor, the hospital affords\nanother distinct advantage in its staff of trained attendants. Of\ncourse they may be brought to one's home, yet not without some delay\nand extra expense; whereas in the hospital their assistance is\ninstantly available. In institutions charity patients are often\ndelivered under more favorable auspices than are the wealthy at their\nhomes. Convalescence likewise is favored at the hospital, since the\nrules which control the admission of visitors guard the mother from\nexhaustion and annoyance. Moreover, isolation such as can only be\nsecured in a hospital is conducive to a well-trained baby.\n\nPatients debating what course to follow often ask when they must\nleave home, what they should take with them, and how long they ought\nto remain at the hospital. The attending circumstances will alter the\nanswers to these questions, but in a general way the following\ndirections will serve as a guide.\n\nOrdinarily, the patient may remain at home until the first warning of\nlabor. Departure from this rule is justified if the patient becomes\nunduly anxious about reaching the hospital in time, especially when\nshe lives some distance from the institution, or if there is any\ndoubt of securing accommodations. In either event, she should go to\nthe hospital at least one week before the confinement is expected.\nThere is no danger in riding to the hospital after labor has begun;\nfrequently, the ride exerts a helpful influence and shortens the\nlabor.\n\nWhatever is to be taken to the hospital should be packed in a bag\nseveral weeks before the predicted date of confinement and put in a\nconvenient place so that one may be spared the trouble of gathering\nit at the last minute. Beside her usual toilet articles, the mother\nwill require several gowns, a dressing-robe, and bedroom slippers.\nClothing for the child will also be needed since most institutions\nstipulate that the infant use its own wearing apparel. If\nimpracticable to transport the entire wardrobe when the mother enters\nthe hospital, so much may be taken as will be needed during the first\nfew days, and other articles may be brought as the need of them\narises. The personal laundry of both mother and infant is usually\ndone outside the institution.\n\nSurgical dressings of every description are provided by the hospital.\nThose who intend to enter a hospital, therefore, may disregard the\nlist of articles necessary for confinement. Similarly, the\nsterilization, the preparations of the room and of the bed, and\npersonal preparations will be of interest only to the patient who\nintends to stay at home.\n\nIt is not always possible for the physician to say how long a patient\nshould remain at the hospital; the rapidity of the mother's\nconvalescence and the progress of the child, both important factors,\ncannot be accurately foretold. Frequently, it is a good plan to\nremain until the infant is four weeks old, but the majority of\npatients are dismissed at a somewhat earlier date. In no instance,\nhowever, should the mother be allowed to leave before the infant is\ntwo weeks old. Even when given the privilege of leaving so early she\nwill always understand that competent assistance must be provided at\nhome, for the mother should not resume her routine duties until six\nweeks after the birth.",

Birth has, however,\nso deep a meaning for the mother, as well as for her family and her\nfriends, and is, above all, so vital to the future of the race, that\nit has naturally become the subject of many impressive superstitions.\nPrimitive peoples have invariably embodied in their religion their\nviews of the origin of life and the phenomena of its inception. With\nthese mysteries Greek and Roman mythology dealt extensively, as did\nalso the myths of the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Chinese, and\nthe people of ancient India. No race, indeed, has lacked its own\ninterpretation of childbirth, and no phase of the process has failed\nto have attributed to it a supernatural significance. A number of\nthese superstitions still distress women on the eve of motherhood. To\ncorrect exaggerations and to deny many utterly false impressions of\nchildbirth there is no better way than to give a frank account of\nwhat does actually occur. I shall adhere to a purely physiological\ndescription of the event, for, although I appreciate fully the fact\nthat its sociological and sentimental aspects are perhaps equally\nimportant, these are not, in my opinion, pertinent to a medical\ndiscussion.\n\nIn a scientific sense the act of birth may be described as a series\nof muscular contractions which widen the birth-canal and expel the\ncontents of the pregnant womb. Since the process requires an\nexpenditure of energy, it has come to be called labor. Intrinsically,\nlabor does not differ from many other physiological acts. The heart\ndrives blood into the arteries; the bladder empties itself; the\nintestine moves its contents and finally expels the undigested\nresidue. All these acts strongly resemble that of birth; but they\nalso differ from it, for the head of the fetus is a hard body which\nresists being molded to the shape of the passageway through which it\nenters the world. To this resistance the pain which accompanies\ndelivery is largely due. And yet even in this respect the act of\nbirth is not unique; certain circumstances lead to painful\ncontractions of the muscle fibers in the intestine and less\nfrequently of those in other organs.\n\nIt is natural to ask what purpose is served by the pain associated\nwith labor; and a moment's reflection will make it clear that one\nreason for the discomfort is the warning which it gives of the\napproach of birth. If the mother were not thus cautioned, she might\nbe delivered under very awkward circumstances, and even under such\nconditions that occasionally the infant would perish the instant it\nwas born. All mammals suffer in giving birth to their young, though\nwith quadrupeds the period of suffering is shorter, for the upright\nposture of man has changed the shape of the pelvis, rendering birth\nsomewhat more difficult. Anyone who observes the lower animals\npreparing for delivery will be convinced that they also are\nresponding to pain, the most compelling call of nature.\n\nThat the suffering is at all essential to the mother's love for her\nchild I cannot believe. Under certain circumstances, as for example\nwhen the Cesarean operation is performed before the onset of labor,\nthe delivery is painless; yet I have never known a mother less\ndevoted to her child on that account. Biology throws no light upon\nthe relation of the \"curse of Eve\" to present-day confinements.\n\nTHE CAUSE OF LABOR.--It is evident that, in a general way, the\nmuscular contractions of the womb cause the birth of the child; but\nbefore we thoroughly understand the act, science must discover what\nstimulates the muscle to contract. Although careful research has thus\nfar failed to disclose the source and character of the stimulus, it\nhas taught many properties of the contractions themselves. Their\nforce has been measured and found to increase as the end of labor is\napproached; the pressure they exert varies between nine and twenty-\nseven pounds. We also know that the patient can neither hasten nor\ndelay the contractions voluntarily. Strong emotions are believed to\naccelerate them at times, and we find a very extraordinary\nillustration of this effect recorded in I Samuel, IV, 19, where we\nread: \"Phineas' wife was with child, near to be delivered; and when\nshe heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her\nfather-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and\ntravailed; for her pains came upon her.\" On the other hand, and much\nmore familiarly, excitement checks the contractions after they have\nbegun. Every obstetrician has heard patients say that with his\narrival the pains died down. Yet such an influence is never\npermanent; the contractions soon reappear, and labor advances as\nthough no interruption had occurred.\n\nFor the artificial induction of labor, the physician has at his\ndisposal means that resemble the method sometimes employed by nature.\nSuitable appliances introduced into the womb provoke contractions,\nand labor proceeds step by step as if the stimulus were a normal one.\nNature does not, however, ordinarily employ mechanical irritation to\nstart the uterine contractions. The initial factor is more remote\nand, as I have said, is not yet well understood.\n\nSince, as everyone admits, delivery occurs with conspicuous\nregularity about the end of the fortieth week of pregnancy, and\npregnancy corresponds, therefore, to ten menstrual cycles, some have\nbeen led to believe that labor and menstruation have a common basis.\nThe truth of this supposition, however, must be doubtful until we\nknow the cause of menstruation. Yet it is a matter of common\nobservation that the uterus becomes unusually irritable about the\ntime when the tenth menstrual period would be due. Strong purgatives\nadministered with other drugs on or after the calculated date\nfrequently bring about delivery, whereas previous attempts of this\nkind prove unsuccessful. To account for this peculiar irritability of\nthe uterus about the fortieth-week of pregnancy, microscopical\nchanges in its tissues have been suggested but sought in vain. Nor\nwill the distention of the organ explain it.\n\nA great many theories have been offered to explain the causation of\nlabor, but they have now only an historical interest. To-day we are\njust beginning to learn the correct methods of studying the problem.\nThe experience of ages has firmly established the fact that the fetus\nis expelled when ready to enter the world, or as we say, when it has\nbecome mature. But how does the fetus assert its maturity? There is\nthe kernel of the matter; that is the real problem, a problem for the\nsolution of which, happily, we possess better facilities than have\nheretofore existed. One solution that has been suggested assumes that\nthe fetus loses ultimately its power to assimilate the nourishment\nprovided through the mother's blood. In consequence, it is argued,\nthe material which previously enabled the fetus to grow now collects--\nin the maternal circulation, stimulating the womb to contract.\n\nA part of this explanation, namely, that the material which\nstimulates the muscle fibers, whatever it may be, is a chemical\nsubstance and that it circulates in the mother's blood, is almost\ncertainly true. There are, however, very weighty reasons for\nbelieving that this substance has not the character of food. A more\nplausible supposition is that the fetus produces this material in the\ncourse of its natural living processes, and the substance would\naccordingly be a waste-product.\n\nTHE COURSE OF LABOR.--The current view that labor begins in the early\nevening and generally ends during the night is incorrect. This\nimpression has grown out of the fact that the whole process\nfrequently consumes twelve hours and must in such an event include\nsome part of the night. Statistical evidence indicates that almost as\nmany births occur at one hour of the twenty-four as another; to be\nprecise, only five per cent. more children are born between 6 P.M.\nand 6 A.M. than between 6 A.M. and 6 P.M.\n\nAs already pointed out, labor commonly begins with transient\ndiscomfort in the lower part of the back. At first the uterine\ncontractions are far apart; they last but a moment and cause only\ntwinges of pain. Gradually, the preliminary contractions give place\nto others of more definite character, which appear at intervals of\nfive to ten minutes. Estimates of the total length of labor will vary\naccording as one counts from the first warning or from the advent of\ntypical contractions which we hear called \"pains of the right kind.\"\nThese generally continue for about four hours, and this period\nrepresents the average length of time the physician remains\nconstantly with his patient. Estimates which include the initial\nsymptoms are longer, varying from ten to eighteen hours. Prolonged\nlabors are rare; and extremely short labors are also infrequent,\nthough now and again it will be only an hour or two from the very\nfirst pain until the child is born.\n\nTo predict absolutely the length of labor for any particular patient\nis impossible. The averages calculated from large groups of cases\nhave no more than a broad scientific interest; when applied to any\nindividual they are apt to be very misleading. Thus, from statistics\nwe should expect the first labor to be longer than subsequent ones,\nbut we are often surprised by an unusually rapid delivery.\n\nTo facilitate description, labor is divided into stages which are\nconveniently designated the first, the second, and the third. During\nthe first stage the way is prepared for the expulsion of the child;\nat the end of the second stage the child is born; the third stage is\noccupied with the separation and the expulsion of the after-birth.\nThe progress of labor may be ascertained from time to time by means\nof suitable examinations. Whereas formerly vaginal examination was\nthe only method which served this purpose, we are now acquainted with\nseveral. For example much of the information necessary for the proper\nmanagement of delivery may be gained from examination of the\npatient's abdomen; and this may be supplemented by observations too\ntechnical to consider here.\n\nOccasionally I have heard doctors accused of negligence because they\nfailed to make numerous vaginal examinations. Censure of this kind\ngenerally is unjust, for discretion in limiting the number of vaginal\nexaminations provides against infection a guarantee which cannot be\noverestimated. In many cases, of course, they are still invaluable\ntoward determining what treatment should be pursued, yet they are\nnever employed to the extent once customary. Moreover, physicians\nhave learned to take extraordinary precautions whenever vaginal\nexaminations must be made.\n\nAnyone who practices obstetrics in these days appreciates how careful\nhe must be, especially of the cleanliness of his hands. Energetic\nscrubbing with soap and water and the free use of antiseptics, as\nphysicians now employ both these measures, appear ridiculous to some\nwomen who have witnessed deliveries under a less stringent regime.\nThey may be bold enough to express their disapproval. They may remind\nus that many women have been successfully delivered without such\ncare. And in this they are correct; we know that nine of every ten\nmothers passed through childbirth uneventfully before modern\nprecautions were dreamed of. Such precautions as are now taken,\nhowever, are necessary to secure the safety of the tenth patient. And\nit is because they are anxious that all their patients shall enjoy\nthe greatest possible security that physicians dare not omit any\nprecaution.\n\nDisinfection of the physician's hands does not entirely exclude the\ndanger of infection through vaginal examinations. Although he may\nhave been most conscientious, there is some risk of carrying\ncontaminating material into the birth-canal from the region about the\nopening of the vagina. Unless that region has been satisfactorily\ndisinfected, sterilizing the dressings and cleansing the hands may\nbecome a waste of time. Sensible patients, therefore, will never\nobject to the preparations which the nurse is instructed to make.\n\nTHE STAGE OF DILATATION.--For reasons which are sufficiently clear,\nthe womb must remain closed while fetal development is in progress;\nbut under normal conditions, when this development is complete, the\nmouth of the womb dilates and the infant is expelled. The infant\nnever takes an active part in its birth, although physicians once\nthought it did and attributed tedious labors to stubbornness on its\npart. The error has been corrected in medical teaching, but many\npersons unacquainted with the facts cling to the idea that the infant\nforces its own way out of the womb.\n\nAt the end of pregnancy the mouth of the womb is small, too small,\noften, to admit an instrument as broad as a lead pencil. It is\nobvious, therefore, that very radical changes must be wrought before\nthe infant can pass. The door, as it were, must be widely opened.\nThis phenomenon, which we call dilatation of the womb, is brought\nabout by involuntary contractions of the muscle fibers in its wall,\nevery point of which they draw upward. Now, the top of the womb is\ndirectly opposite its mouth, consequently the contractions inevitably\npull its lips wider and wider apart. Ordinarily another factor is\nconcerned in this mechanism. To understand the whole process we must\nrecall that a fluid surrounds the fetus, and that this fluid is\ncontained within elastic membranes. The uterine contractions compress\nthe fluid, drive the membranes, like a wedge, into the mouth of the\nwomb and spread its lips apart. Thus, to the pulling effect just\nmentioned, a pushing force is added. After full dilatation has been\naccomplished and the membranes can serve no further purpose, they\nrupture; as the midwife puts it, \"the bag of waters breaks.\" The\nquantity of fluid which escapes will vary. Occasionally, a huge gush\nwill drench the patient's clothing; but more often what is lost at\nfirst amounts to only a few teaspoonfuls, though small quantities of\nfluid often dribble away with subsequent contractions.\n\nAlthough not the rule, it is by no means unusual for the membrane to\nrupture at the onset of labor, or at least before the mouth of the\nwomb is fully dilated. Exceptionally, rupture occurs a few days\nbefore labor begins; and still longer intervals, though extremely\nrare, have been recorded. Whenever the membranes rupture prematurely,\nthe pushing force of the uterine contractions becomes less effective,\nthough the pulling force is never impaired. Under these\ncircumstances, which occasion what is called a \"dry labor,\" delivery\nis apt to proceed slowly, yet that does not follow necessarily, for\nthe part of the fetus which happens to lie over the mouth of the womb\nmay act as efficiently as the unruptured membrane would.\n\nDuring the first stage, the longest of the three, the patient is\ncomfortable between the contractions and generally interests herself\nin some diverting occupation. The presence of the physician can be of\nno assistance then, and patients rarely demand it. Usually, they are\nsatisfied to know he is ready to come when called. It is wrong to\ndeceive patients with various recommendations from which they will\nvainly expect help during this stage; their welfare is best served\nwhen they are left alone. Generally the advice of well-meaning\nfriends will be as harmless as it is futile, yet I must emphasize\nthat during the first stage straining to expel the fetus is ill\nadvised. Such effort will surely be ineffective then and may exhaust\nthe patient; in that event it becomes harmful, for she will be\nfatigued when she most needs strength.\n\nSince, during the first stage, the progress of delivery is not\ninfluenced by what the patient may choose to do, she may follow her\nown inclinations. The average patient will be restless and will keep\non her feet most of the time; alternately she will walk or stand\nstill as one or the other happens to make her more comfortable. As a\ncontraction begins she often seeks support, leaning upon a chair or\nbending over the foot of the bed, and presses with her hands against\nthe lower part of her back. Patients may sit down or lie down\nwhenever they wish; if so inclined they may even go to sleep.\n\nMost patients take no food during the whole course of labor, but, if\nnourishment is desired, there is no reason for abstaining from it.\nThey may always drink water as freely as they like, and may also have\nmilk, weak tea or coffee, or broth; but alcoholic beverages should\nnever be taken without the specific consent of the physician. This\nsame caution applies to strong coffee and tea. If desired, crackers\nor toast and rice or other cereals may be eaten in reasonable\nquantity. For fear of vomiting a patient will occasionally be told\nnot to partake of any food. This advice is given, not because the\nsymptom is alarming, but to save her needless annoyance. Indeed,\nvomiting frequently indicates that dilatation is well advanced, and,\ntherefore, may generally be regarded as an encouraging sign.\nOrdinarily a persistent inclination to have the bowels move has the\nsame significance. On the other hand, a constant desire to empty the\nbladder is more prominent at the onset of labor than later.\n\nTo know the moment which marks the transition from the first to the\nsecond stage of labor can be of no benefit to the patient; but for\nthe medical attendant the greatest interest centers about this point.\nCasual observation sometimes enables the physician to recognize it,\nfor characteristically at the close of the first stage the whole\npicture changes. In a typical case the membranes will rupture at this\ninstant, expulsive efforts will begin, and, as we have just learned,\nthere may be symptoms referable to pressure. Moreover, a blood-tinged\ndischarge, spoken of as the \"show,\" usually makes its appearance\nabout the same time. Since slight bleeding frequently occurs at the\nbeginning of labor, or a little later, this manifestation, like all\nothers, may not be implicitly trusted to indicate the end of the\nfirst stage. Such uncertainty, however, is a matter of no great\nconsequence, for in the absence of all these symptoms the physician\nmay, if necessary, accurately determine the degree of dilatation by\nan internal examination.\n\nTHE STAGE OF EXPULSION.--The term delivery has been broadly applied\nto include the whole of labor. More strictly, its use should be\nlimited to the second stage, for this period alone is concerned with\nthe actual birth of the child. Although dilatation has been\ncompleted, the uterine contractions continue, devoting their force to\nemptying the womb. In this they now receive assistance from the\nvoluntary contractions of the abdominal muscles.\n\nThe second stage is very much shorter than the first; for this reason\nand others, too, it proves much less trying. As the child is moved\ndownward through the birth-canal, the mother usually appreciates for\nherself that she is making headway; whereas in the first stage she\nmay know of progress only through what she is told. Moreover, it is\npossible in this stage for the physician, by means of inhalations of\nchloroform, to relieve her of the pain attending the expulsion of the\nchild.\n\nSince the anesthetic properties of chloroform were discovered by an\nobstetrician who was searching for a drug with which to lessen the\npain of childbirth, the facts connected with the discovery have a\npeculiar interest for mothers. Sir James Y. Simpson had always been\nanxious for some means to prevent the suffering endured during\nsurgical operations \"without interfering with the free and healthy\nplay of the natural functions.\" He, therefore, welcomed the\nintroduction of ether anesthesia from America; and in January, 1847,\nat the Edinburgh Medical School, administered ether to an obstetrical\npatient. This was the first instance in which an anesthetic was\nemployed at the time of childbirth. Since ether, to his mind, had\ncertain shortcomings, Simpson set about finding another anesthetic,\nand devoted all his spare time to testing the effect of numerous\ndrugs upon himself. How he came to try chloroform has been vividly\ntold by one of his neighbors. [Footnote: \"Late one evening, it was\nthe 4th of November, 1847, Dr. Simpson, with his two friends and\nassistants, Drs. Keith and Duncan, sat down to their somewhat\nhazardous work in Dr. Simpson's dining room. Having inhaled several\nsubstances, but without much effect, it occurred to Dr. Simpson to\ntry a ponderous material which he had formerly set aside on a lumber-\ntable, and which, on account of its great weight, he had hitherto\nregarded as of no likelihood whatever; that happened to be a small\nbottle of chloroform. It was searched for and recovered from beneath\na heap of waste paper. And with each tumbler newly changed, the\ninhalers resumed their vocation. Immediately an unwonted hilarity\nseized the party--they became bright-eyed, very happy, and very\nloquacious--expatiating upon the delicious aroma of the new fluid.\nBut suddenly there was talk of sounds being heard like those of a\ncotton mill, louder and louder; a moment more, and then all was\nquiet--and then a crash! On awakening, Dr. Simpson's first perception\nwas mental--'This is far stronger and better than ether,' said he to\nhimself. Hearing a noise, he turned round and saw Dr. Duncan beneath\na chair, quite unconscious, and snoring in a most determined manner.\nMore noise still and much motion. And then his eyes overtook Dr.\nKeith's feet and legs making valorous attempts to overturn the supper\ntable. By and by Dr. Simpson having regained his seat, Dr. Duncan\nhaving finished his uncomfortable and unrefreshing slumber, Dr. Keith\nhaving come to an arrangement with the table and its contents, the\n_sederunt_ was resumed. Each expressed himself delighted with\nthis new agent, and its inhalation was repeated many times that\nnight. Miss Petrie, a niece of Mrs. Simpson, gallantly took her place\nand turn at the table, and fell asleep, crying: 'I'm an angel! Oh,\nI'm an angel!'\"--Quoted from \"The Life of Sir James Young Simpson,\"\nby H. Laing Gordon; Masters of Medicine Series.]\n\nThe introduction of chloroform met with violent opposition, not upon\nmedical grounds alone, but also for moral and religious reasons. \"To\ncheck the sensation of pain in connection with the visitations of\nGod,\" zealous theologians announced, \"was to contravene the decrees\nof an all-wise Creator.\" Simpson reminded them \"that the Creator,\nduring the process of extracting the rib from Adam, must necessarily\nhave adopted a somewhat similar artifice--for did not God throw Adam\nin a deep sleep?\" Nevertheless, a number of years passed before the\nprejudice against artificial sleep was overcome. Chloroform only\nbecame popular after Queen Victoria consented to its use at the birth\nof her seventh child, Prince Leopold, in 1853.\n\nThere is still some difference of opinion regarding the routine\nemployment of chloroform in obstetrical practice, though the weight\nof authority favors its use during the contractions at the end of the\nsecond stage, providing always that no preexisting organic\nderangement renders the drug dangerous. Under no circumstances,\nhowever, should chloroform be given in the first stage, and seldom at\nthe beginning of the second. Prolonged administration will exert an\ninjurious influence upon both mother and child; under these\nconditions it ultimately weakens the uterine contractions and delays\nthe delivery. Such an effect must be avoided, since it would endanger\nthe life of the child by asphyxiation as well as exhaust the mother.\nOn the other hand, a few drops of chloroform inhaled with each pain\ntoward the end of the second stage will dull sensibility, although\nconsciousness remains unaffected. When the drug is thus administered,\nthe uterine contractions are scarcely, if at all, altered, and the\nassistance which the patient is willing to give herself generally\nbecomes more powerful. Should the anesthetic have the opposite\neffect, it must be withheld; but that is seldom necessary. As the\nhead advances the anesthesia is deepened, and the mother sleeps\nsoundly while the child is being born.\n\nAs long as dilatation is in progress, the patient may sit up or walk\nabout; but with the advent of the second stage she should go to bed,\nfor there she will be able to make the best use of the expulsive\npains. The appropriate posture for delivery is still the subject of\ndispute, though modern views in no instance advocate the unnatural\nabsurdities formerly supported by custom or superstition. Students of\nethnology relate that among savage tribes almost every conceivable\nposition was advocated for women in labor. Subsequently it became\ncustomary to have delivery take place in specially constructed chairs\nwhich are still used in semi-enlightened countries. With civilized\nnations at present women are always delivered in bed; yet national\npeculiarities still prevail. Some physicians favor what is known as\nthe English position, in which the patient lies on her left side with\nher face inclined toward the chest, the trunk bent toward the knees,\nand the legs drawn up toward the abdomen. The majority of\nobstetricians, however, prefer that the patient should lie flat on\nher back. With the average case, and from the standpoint of facility\nin delivery, which of these postures happens to be chosen is a matter\nof indifference. But it is so much less awkward for the physician\nwhen the patient is on her back that this position has been widely\nadopted in America.\n\nDuring the expulsion of the child the mother intuitively desires to\nhelp herself; generally she cannot resist straining, and rarely needs\nencouragement. Assisting the uterine contractions with voluntary\nmuscular effort, the act commonly described as \"bearing down,\" may be\nperformed most effectively when the patient is lying on her back. The\nknees are drawn up and spread apart; the feet are braced against some\nfirm object; the hands grasp straps fastened at the foot of the bed;\nand the head is slightly raised so as to bring the chin near the\nchest. When the contraction begins the patient takes a deep breath\nand holds it while she strains vigorously, as if to make her bowels\nmove. All voluntary effort should cease as the contraction wears\naway, for straining between the contractions can accomplish nothing.\nHer own inclination to \"bear down\" will clearly indicate to the\npatient when she ought to act.\n\nIn the second stage patients regularly experience a feeling of\npressure against the rectum, and this sensation, since it depends\nupon a low position of the child's head, is a welcome sign. Cramps in\nthe legs also indicate progress, for they result from similar\npressure against nerves adjacent to the lower part of the birth-\ncanal. The cramps disappear immediately after the child is born, and\nare consequently never dangerous. Straightening out the legs or\nrubbing them usually gives relief. Most women, however, complain\nduring the expulsive period only of pain in the back, and find\nnothing so grateful as firm pressure over this region.\n\nEnergetic efforts quickly bring the head to the outlet of the birth-\ncanal, where it may be seen, at first only during the contractions,\nbut later during the pauses as well. The crown of the child's head is\ngenerally directed upward and becomes fixed against the pubic bones\nof the mother, which lie just in front of the bladder. Around this\nfirm pivot the child's head rotates upward, and, as a result of the\nmovement, forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, and chin successively emerge\nfrom the birth-canal. Following the birth of the head, natural forces\nturn the body upon one side, the better to accommodate the shoulders\nto the passageway. After these are born, the rest of the body slips\neasily into the world, and the second stage ends.\n\nTHE PLACENTAL STAGE.--Although the third stage is chiefly concerned\nwith the separation and the delivery of the after-birth, on which\naccount it is known as the placental period, the description of other\nno less remarkable events belongs here. Even after the infant is born\nthe umbilical cord extends from its navel to the placenta, just as it\nhas done throughout pregnancy. Among larger mammals separation of the\nnew-born from the mother is brought about in one of two ways;\nsometimes the activity of the young breaks the navel-string, though\nmore frequently the mother bites it in two. Both these methods, we\nare told, have been employed by savages; but at the beginning of\ncivilization it became customary to sever the cord with a cutting\ntool, and the tie thrown round it represents the first attempt of man\nto ligate blood-vessels. Ordinarily there is no need for haste in\nthis operation. On the contrary, some delay is often of advantage,\nsince an appreciable quantity of blood that otherwise would remain in\nthe placenta is thus given opportunity to enter the infant's body.\nAccording to present ideas, as long as the heart-beat can be felt in\nthe cord it should not be tied.\n\nThe sleep induced toward the close of the previous stage lasts for a\nfew minutes, so that most patients are unconscious through the\ngreater part of the brief placental stage. Before the influence of\nthe anesthetic has worn off, the physician has an excellent\nopportunity to sew up any laceration which may have occurred in the\ncourse of delivery. Slight injuries are not uncommon, especially if\nthe confinement be the first, for the most skillful treatment often\nfails to prevent them. Since superficial tears are never serious if\npromptly closed, it is not their occurrence, but the failure to\nrecognize them, or to sew them up when they are recognized, that\ndeserves condemnation.\n\nAfter the birth of the child the womb becomes smaller, its walls grow\nthicker, and the cavity within is narrowed. This series of changes\npartly detaches the placenta, but the separation depends chiefly upon\nthe uterine contractions. These contractions also force the after-\nbirth into the vagina, whence it may ultimately be dislodged by the\npatient if she bears down again. Usually, however, it is preferable\nto save her further efforts of this kind, and, as a routine, the\nphysician places one hand upon the abdominal wall, grasps the womb,\nand, during the contraction, makes firm pressure downward. The\nmaneuver expels the after-birth, which consists of the placenta, the\nmembranes, and the umbilical cord. Then the empty womb will form a\nhard, spherical mass about the size of the child's head, lying just\nabove or to one side of the bladder.\n\nSlight bleeding also occurs during the third stage, and further loss\nof blood follows the removal of the after-birth. The total loss\nvaries between a half pint and a pint, though larger amounts may be\nnoted occasionally without appreciable effect upon the mother.\nNaturally, large, robust women can spare much more blood than those\nwho are anemic. And yet pregnancy invariably prepares the mother for\na loss of blood that would alarm anyone unfamiliar with obstetrical\npractice. Often the woman just delivered is not harmed by a\nhemorrhage that would endanger the life of a healthy man. This may\nseem paradoxical, but it is not; for the surplus blood, which\nformerly performed important duties in connection with the nutrition\nof the fetus, must now be removed to readjust the mother's\ncirculation.\n\nIn a very small number of cases an unduly large loss of blood follows\nthe expulsion of the placenta. Fortunately, by treatment which\nconsists usually in spurring Nature to more vigorous action we are\nwell equipped to deal with this emergency. A wonderful mechanism has\nbeen provided by Nature to control excessive bleeding after delivery.\nIf the forces upon which this mechanism depends are sluggish, the\nphysician stimulates them. As in the preceding stages, the muscle\nfibers of the uterus supply the power in question, and because of\nthis role an observant obstetrician once called them, \"living\nligatures.\" Certain of these fibers encircle the mouths of the blood-\nvessels which have been left open through the detachment of the\nplacenta. When they contract the vessels are squeezed, impeding the\nescape of blood. The necessity of this action explains the\ncontractions which continue even after the placenta has been\nexpelled, when they are vigorous enough to cause discomfort they are\nspoken of as \"after-pains.\" After-pains seldom follow the birth of\nthe first child, but they regularly follow later confinements. In any\ncase, such contractions do not persist very long, for tiny clots form\nwithin the blood vessels and effectually close them. As soon as the\nlining of the womb has been restored the clots are absorbed, leaving\nthe organ in much the same condition as before conception took place.\n\nTHE EFFECT OF LABOR UPON THE CHILD.--Unless the experience of\ncountless generations had taught us otherwise, we should fear the\nchild would be injured by its passage through the birth-canal.\nImmediately after the birth evidence of the journey is seldom\nwanting, but it quickly disappears.\n\nThe unusual size of the infant's brain requires the head to be large,\nand bestows upon it a contour which differs from that of the mother's\npelvic cavity. Since the bones of the pelvis are rigid, while those\nof the fetal skull are malleable, the head is molded as it descends\ninto the pelvic cavity, so that its passage may be made the easier.\nAs the result of this process of accommodation the skull becomes\nrelatively longer from crown to chin than in adults. Within a few\nweeks, however, the modification vanishes. If an infant is born with\nthe buttocks first, the head does not linger in the birth-canal, a\nfact which in such cases explains the pleasing shape of the skull,\nwhich emerges with the contour determined by fetal growth.\n\nWhenever a soft swelling appears over that portion of the scalp which\nwas foremost during the birth, the curiosity of the family is\naroused; but the swelling is harmless and subsides quickly. It\noriginates for the same reason that a finger swells if too tight a\nring is worn, which, as everyone knows, is because of interference\nwith the circulation. Just as the swelling of the finger disappears\nwhen the constriction is removed, so the swelling of the scalp\nsubsides shortly after the child is born. Usually no trace of it can\nbe found the next day; but even when more persistent it will always\nvanish after a short time.\n\nFor the child the most notable result of labor relates to the\nrevolutionary changes in its mode of existence. Up to the time of\nbirth the fetus received nourishment by way of the placenta, but\nafter separation from the mother another source of food must be\nfound. The health of the tissues, perpetually in need of oxygen,\nrequires that the lungs act very promptly. Contact with the air,\nwhich is cooler than the previous environment of the child, irritates\nthe nerve-endings in the skin; in response to the sensation thus\nproduced breathing is established automatically. Whenever the\ntemperature stimulus proves insufficient, physicians employ a\nstronger one, spanking the child until it cries lustily. Crying not\nonly expands the lungs, but also has a favorable influence upon\nneedful alterations in the fetal circulation.\n\nThe lungs, since they must from this time on provide oxygen for the\ninfant, need to receive more blood than formerly. The vessels leading\ntoward them must be widely opened, and structures which previously\ndiverted the blood-stream to the navel must be closed. The intricate\nshifting of forces which produces the change cannot be understood\nwithout a knowledge of anatomy; it will suffice for us to know that\nthe blood is drawn into the vessels of the lungs with each\ninspiration. Other changes also occur. On account of some of these,\nnamely, certain alterations in the blood current through the heart,\nphysicians once taught that newly born infants should always be laid\nupon the right side. Except in very unusual cases, that precaution is\nnow regarded as unnecessary.\n\nOf all the elements essential to nutrition, oxygen is the only one\nrequired immediately after birth; as the child enters the world well\nstocked with all the others. Babies are not born hungry, as many\npeople seem to think. Neither is their crying a proof of it, for, as\nwe have observed, they have other very good reasons for crying; nor\nis their readiness to suck anything that comes in contact with the\nmouth, for they will behave in the same way while they are receiving\nan abundance of nourishment through the umbilical cord. Many hours\npass before a newly born infant can possibly need food. Indeed, it\ncould survive a week or longer without taking anything, by mouth,\nexcept water. The ability to suckle at birth merely indicates that\nthe infant is prepared to utilize the mechanism which nature will now\nemploy to sustain it.\n\nAfter the umbilical cord has been severed the blood vessels within it\ncan serve no further purpose. Consequently the remnant of this\nstructure attached to the child's abdomen begins to shrivel. Formerly\nthe care of the stump was considered a trivial matter; when\ncleanliness was neglected decomposition caused more rapid separation\nthan takes place under the treatment which it now receives. No\nannoyance should be felt because the cord hangs on a long time;\nindeed, such an experience means it has been given exceptionally good\ncare. Separation rarely occurs before the end of a week. It may be\ndeferred for two weeks, or even longer, if the stump has been kept\nperfectly clean. After the shriveled cord drops off, the skin around\nthe navel contracts, leaving a small raw area which discharges a\nyellow fluid for two or three days before the healing is complete.\n\nMEDDLING.--In selecting a physician the patient will almost certainly\nhave been guided by her confidence in his ability. It may seem\nstrange, therefore, to insist that he be allowed to conduct the\ndelivery as he thinks best. Nevertheless, suggestions from outsiders\nare so common, especially if the labor be at all prolonged, that it\nseems appropriate to warn patients to pay no attention to such\nadvice. In the heat of excitement well-meaning relatives are\nsometimes inclined to interfere, and women who are not members of the\nfamily occasionally wish to discuss their experiences, irrelevant as\nthey may be.\n\nThe patient's intimate friends, quite naturally, have the keenest\npersonal interest in the event, an interest that of itself\ndisqualifies them from reasoning calmly at the time. Their influence\nmay be positively harmful if they persuade the physician to undertake\nprocedures which his judgment convinces him are inadvisable. Should\nhe turn a deaf ear, they will think him lacking in sympathy; but\nshould he adopt their suggestions he would assume the full\nresponsibility, and would perhaps be censured later by the very\npersons whom he sought to please. There can be no question of the\nproper course for him to pursue. Any influence which such entreaties\nmay have will always be in the direction of too early interference,\nwhich is fraught with danger to mother and child alike. The master-\nword is patience, and it applies alike to the mother herself, to the\ndoctor, and to her friends.\n\nAlmost always the whole duty of the doctor consists in watching the\nprogress of labor, so that he may be ready to render assistance\nshould it be needed. Until the second stage begins there is no real\nnecessity for him to remain in the room. Indeed, it is better for him\nnot to do so after he has made sure that satisfactory conditions\nprevail, for his judgment will be less biased if the patient is not\ncontinuously under his observation.\n\nJUSTIFIABLE INTERVENTION.--It is quite true that in the progress of\nthe birth difficulties now and then arise; yet they are far less\ncommon than rumor would lead us to believe. The unusual always\nattracts attention, often receiving greater emphasis than it merits.\nThe particulars of confinement provide no exception to this rule; a\ndelivery which requires artificial aid will be talked about, while\nhundreds that terminate naturally pass without comment. In this way\nthe public gets an exaggerated notion of the frequency of difficult\nlabors. Moreover, the nature of the trouble is usually distorted, for\nreports of medical events are apt to be incorrect, and errors\nmultiply with each rehearsal. Obstetrical patients who wish, so far\nas possible, to escape the depressing influence of such inaccurate\nreports will be most likely to succeed if they follow the advice to\nselect a physician at the beginning of pregnancy. When this is done\nthe physician will have opportunity to explain or discredit alarming\nrumors, a task which it is usually necessary for him to perform, for\nthere are always some persons who feel that a prospective mother\nshould listen to everything that they have heard of childbirth.\n\nThe most frequent cause for intervention during labor is\ninsufficiency of the muscular contractions to overcome the resistance\nof the birth-canal. Unusual resistance of this kind explains the\nlonger labors of women who have passed middle life before becoming\npregnant. They may need to exercise more patience than younger women,\nthough they have no greater reason to apprehend serious difficulties.\nWhenever rigidity of the muscles adjacent to the birth-canal arrests\ndelivery the physician may employ the obstetrical forceps, which have\nbeen in use since the seventeenth century.\n\nAlthough it is widely known that physicians sometimes terminate labor\nin this way, the public estimate of the merits and of the limitations\nof the instrument is so inexact that the truth about it should be\nunderstood. Obstetrical forceps were devised by one of the\nChamberlens, a family of French Huguenots who fled to England in\n1569. The invention was long kept a secret; therefore its date cannot\nbe fixed, nor even the inventor clearly identified, though everyone\nagrees that he was a member of this family. Clearly the instrument\nhad been in use for some generations prior to Hugh Chamberlen, who\ntranslated from French into English the foremost obstetrical textbook\nof his time. The book, published in 1672, does not contain a\ndescription of the forceps, but in his preface Hugh Chamberlen refers\nto delay in delivery, saying, \"My father, my brothers, and myself\n(though none else in Europe as I know) have by God's blessing and our\nown industry attained to and long practiced a way to deliver women\nwithout prejudice to them or their infants in this case.\" It is not\nquestioned that the forceps was the secret that his ancestors and he\nhimself employed so long and so profitably. About a century ago what\nare probably the original models of the instrument were discovered in\na country home of Essex which once belonged to the Chamberlens; there\nthey had been hidden in a trunk in the garret. The box in which they\nwere concealed contained four pairs of forceps, representing\ndifferent stages in their development, besides other instruments and\na number of letters which established their ownership.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to sell the family secret in Paris,\nHugh Chamberlen found a purchaser in Amsterdam. The privilege of\nusing it in Holland was then granted physicians for a monetary\nconsideration, and that practice continued until two philanthropists\npurchased the secret to make it public. It was ultimately learned,\nhowever, that the sale was a swindle, for the device which the\npurchasers obtained consisted of only half the genuine instrument.\nThe real secret was revealed by a son of Hugh Chamberlen, who bore\nthe same name as his father; but probably the first accurate printed\ndescription of the forceps was made by Samuel Chapman, in his\ntreatise on obstetrics which appeared in 1733. Subsequently they came\ninto general use, and, with many modifications, remain the most\nimportant instrument in the obstetrician's equipment. There can be no\nexaggeration in the claim that the instrument has done more to save\nhuman life than any other surgical appliance.\n\nThe obstetrical forceps have been of such great service in\ndiminishing the number of still-born infants that they were once\ncalled the child's instrument. The need of its employment in behalf\nof the child may be determined by careful observation of the fetal\nheart-sounds, which are heard over the mother's abdomen, and by means\nof which one may learn the condition of the child. Signs of danger\nare extremely uncommon so long as dilatation of the womb is not\ncomplete, for any strain which labor may impose upon the child will\nusually occur during its passage through the pelvis. Most often,\ntherefore, the head has reached the outermost part of the birth canal\nbefore extraction becomes advisable.\n\nThe forceps are used also on behalf of the mother, if the\ncontinuation of labor seems likely to throw undue stress upon her. On\nthis account the physician frequently resorts to them if his patient\nis suffering from pneumonia, typhoid fever, or any acute illness at\nthe time of labor. Other maternal indications for their use include\nvarious chronic derangements, well exemplified by certain diseases of\nthe heart. Furthermore, even when there are no preexisting\ncomplications forceps are employed on account of exhaustion or other\nconditions which may develop during the course of labor. It must be\nclearly understood, however, that the physician alone can determine\nwhen intervention is justified, as well as what operative procedure\nis most appropriate; for even though good reasons for terminating\nlabor exist, forceps cannot be properly used unless nature has\nalready fulfilled very definite requirements. By no chance can the\npatient, much less her friends, decide this matter. And besides, none\nbut a trained observer can detect the symptoms which clearly indicate\nNature's incompetence to effect delivery. Disregard of these truths\nby the family with consequent urging that something be done must be\nheld partly responsible for the reckless use of the instrument. It\nwill be a step in the right direction, therefore, when the laity\ncomes to understand that the value of the instrument generally\npertains to the welfare of the child, and that, in any event, its use\nwill be harmful if employed before the womb has been completely\ndilated.\n\nAlthough forceps can be employed only in cases of head presentation,\nintervention may be warranted when some part of the fetus other than\nthe head will be born first. Two or three times in every hundred\npatients we meet with breech presentations, that is, cases in which\nthe buttocks precede; after their expulsion, the body, the arms, and\nthe head follow. Breech presentations occur more frequently among\nwomen delivered prematurely, as might be expected since an\nexamination eight to ten weeks before the calculated date reveals a\nlarger percentage of breech presentations than a similar examination\nabout the normal end of pregnancy. In explanation of these results we\naccept the view that the size of the fetus at the earlier date does\nnot require nicety of adaptation to the cavity of the womb, whereas\nat term, unless the child is small, the best accommodation is secured\nwhen the head lies downward.\n\nMost breech cases are delivered spontaneously; if not, the outlook\nfor the mother is no less favorable on that account. Assistance, when\nundertaken, is usually prompted in the interest of the child, which\nwill be seized by the legs and extracted if there are indications to\nterminate labor. Purely as a precautionary measure, a second\nphysician will often be called about the time the stage of expulsion\nbegins. Foresight of this kind must give the patient confidence\nrather than alarm her. Indeed, should operative intervention of any\nkind become necessary in the practice of obstetrics, the inclination\nof the doctor to call an assistant must be regarded as an evidence of\nsuperior judgment.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF BIRTH WITHOUT A DOCTOR.--A prospective mother should\nnot be left alone during the four weeks prior to the expected date of\ndelivery, for it is important that during this period aid may be\nquickly summoned in the event of an emergency. However, if the\nconfinement be the first, ample warning of delivery will always be\ngiven. Even in a later confinement several hours will probably elapse\nbetween the preliminary signs and the birth itself. It is extremely\nrare to have labor progress so rapidly that the child is born before\nthe doctor arrives. Under such circumstances, if the nurse be present\nshe will be master of the situation; whenever she has been unable to\nreach the patient, someone near by should be called to render what\nassistance may be needed. A labor which advances so rapidly that\nskilled assistance cannot be procured is proof in itself that\neverything is going in an ideal manner, and that interference is not\nnecessary. Although the doctor may not arrive until after the child\nis born, he frequently renders valuable service in expelling the\nplacenta or in sewing up lacerations. No one should presume then that\nthere is never need for a physician after the second stage is over.\n\nIf the suggestions made in the preceding chapter are heeded,\nimmediately after labor begins the room will be set in order and the\nbed will be properly protected; the patient will take a tub-bath and\nwill put on a freshly laundered nightgown. The sterilized dressings\nare then placed where they can be easily reached, but are not opened\nuntil needed. Antiseptic tablets have been procured, and, following\nthe directions on the bottle, it will be simple to make up a solution\nof bichlorid of mercury of a strength of 1-1,000.\n\nAfter the contractions become strong and return at intervals of five\nminutes, or if the waters have broken, the patient should go to bed;\nthe knees should be drawn up and spread apart, but bearing down with\nthe pains should not begin until the inclination is irresistible,\nsince this forbearance will make the delivery slower and thus afford\nprotection against lacerations which physicians ordinarily seek to\nprevent by the use of chloroform. In the absence of a doctor it is\nnever permissible to administer this or any other anesthetic. As long\nas a physician familiar with its action gives the chloroform untoward\nresults need not be feared in obstetrical cases; but the risk would\nbe too great to allow anyone to give it who was unacquainted with the\nearly signs of an over-dose. Again, fear of accident should prevent\npatients from using the closet when labor is progressing rapidly, for\nan inclination to empty the bladder or the rectum often signifies\nthat birth is about to take place. Even though this is true, if there\nis need, patients may try to use the bed-pan.\n\nAbout the time when the patient goes to bed the attendant prepares to\nrender such assistance as may be required. First she should scrub her\nhands thoroughly with soap and water and subsequently soak them in\nthe bichlorid solution for five minutes, or longer if there be no\nneed for haste. A large delivery-pad is then placed under the\npatient, the leggins put on, and, from this moment, the outlet of the\nbirth-canal should be exposed to view. After the scalp of the child\ncomes into sight, the attendant is not to leave the bed-side, though\nshe must keep \"hands off\" until the head has been completely\nexpelled.\n\nA pause occurs between the birth of the head and of the rest of the\nbody. It is usually safe to await further expulsive contractions, but\nshould the child's face turn a dusky blue, which indicates that it\nneeds to breathe, the patient is to be advised to strain vigorously\nand to make firm pressure over the womb with both her hands. At the\nsame time the attendant must pull the child downward, having seized\nits chin with one hand and the back of its head with the other. The\nstraining of the mother combined with traction by the attendant will\nbe certain to effect delivery quickly. As soon as the child is born,\nit should take a breath and begin to cry. If it does not cry of its\nown accord, it can usually be made to do so by holding it up by the\nfeet and slapping it on the back several times. Subsequently the\nchild is placed between the patient's legs in such a way as to\nprevent stretching of the cord. Usually the nurse will leave it in\nthis position and turn her attention to the mother.\n\nAfter the birth of the child it is easy to feel through the mother's\nabdominal wall, which has now become lax and flabby, the organs which\nlie beneath it. The top of the womb, once just below the edge of the\nribs, may now be found about the level of the uppermost part of the\nhip bones, a position which it keeps until detachment of the after-\nbirth begins. As the after-birth peels off, the firmly contracted\nwomb gradually rises in the abdominal cavity, and by the time when\nthe separation has been completed reaches the region of the navel.\n\nWhile these changes, which naturally require from ten to thirty\nminutes and occasionally longer, are taking place, the attendant must\nwait patiently; attempts to hurry the separation of the placenta are\nnever wise, for they may lead to excessive bleeding. No effort should\nbe made to bring away the after-birth by pulling upon the cord. It is\nequally unwise for inexperienced persons to press upon the womb in\nthe hope of pushing out the placenta. To encourage the mother to\nstrain just as she did in assisting the birth of the child would\nalways be a safer plan. And if that is ineffective, further delay is\nnecessary; in several instances a natural separation of the placenta\nhas repaid me for waiting as long as two hours. Prolonged delay may\nbe annoying, yet, provided that the doctor arrives within a\nreasonable time, it can scarcely lead to anything more serious than\nannoyance. Rather than authorize frantic efforts to remove the\nafterbirth, I should much prefer to have a patient of my own call\nanother doctor.\n\nIf the after-birth comes away of its own accord, as will generally\nhappen when due patience has been exercised, it may be severed from\nthe child and put aside for the inspection of the doctor, for he\nshould learn by examining it whether everything has come away\nproperly. The cord must be securely tied in two places with the\nsterilized bobbin mentioned in the list of articles for confinement.\nOne ligature is applied about two inches from the child's abdomen,\nthe other an inch nearer the placenta; the cord is then cut between\nthem with a pair of sterile scissors. Anyone fearful of injuring the\ninfant may prevent accident by spreading a diaper under the part of\nthe cord to be severed. This precaution also protects the bed from\nsoiling, for there will be a single spurt of blood the instant the\ncord is cut. So long as the child is in good condition there is no\nurgent need of this operation. If the child is breathing\nsatisfactorily it may generally be deferred until the doctor arrives.\nWhen this course is chosen the attendant will wrap the infant in a\nwarm blanket, place it along with the after-birth in a safe spot, and\nsubsequently devote herself to making the mother comfortable.\n\nThe vulva and neighboring parts are bathed with a 1-1000 bichlorid\nsolution. Soiled dressings are removed, the gown changed, and, if\nnecessary, clean sheets put on the bed. A sterile sanitary pad is\nplaced over the vulva and a fresh one substituted as often as\nnecessary, but none of the pads should be destroyed. All the\ndressings must be saved so that the doctor may see how much blood has\nbeen lost. As we have learned, bleeding regularly occurs while the\nplacenta is separating and thereafter; excessive bleeding will rarely\nfollow a normal delivery if the attendant has heeded the precaution\nto leave everything to nature. If ever the loss of blood should\nbecome alarming before the doctor arrives, it is advisable to raise\nthe foot of the bed, to keep the patient quietly on her back, to\ngrasp the womb through the abdominal wall, and to massage it\nconstantly until the nearest physician can be gotten.\n\nOf these directions the most important is that which relates to the\nmanagement of the womb, for in cases in which labor has been normal\nin other respects the relaxation of its muscle is most often\nresponsible for flooding. What to do in this event must therefore be\nmade plain. First the patient should try to empty her bladder, and,\nif she cannot, pressure made above the organ will usually expel the\nurine. The attendant will then take her seat on the edge of the bed,\nfacing the patient's feet, and will locate the womb. When there is\nflooding one may expect to recognize the womb as a large, rather soft\nmass lying in the mid-line of the abdomen with its upper margin\nsomewhat above the navel. With one hand, or with both if necessary,\nthe mass is grasped in such a way that the fingers cover the top of\nit and pass backward toward the spinal column; the thumb remains in\ncontact with the front of the organ. The womb is stroked and squeezed\nmuch as one kneads dough, and for this reason the procedure is\ntechnically called kneading. Such manipulations cause the muscle\nfibers to contract firmly, and in consequence the blood vessels are\ntightly closed and bleeding ceases. Similarly, cold applications to\nthe abdominal wall tend to provoke uterine contractions; placing over\nthe womb an ice-cap or towels wrung out of cold water and doubled\nseveral times often have a beneficial influence when there is a\ntendency toward relaxation. Some physicians also recommend that the\nchild be placed at the breast, since suckling is known to cause\nuterine contractions. There are other measures which are occasionally\nemployed, but they should be used only by physicians, for in the\nhands of an inexperienced person they may do more harm than good.\n\nVery often a slight chill follows labor. It has a nervous origin and\nneed never give uneasiness; a drink of warm milk, hot-water bags to\nthe feet, and extra blankets will be sure to make the mother\ncomfortable. On the other hand, excitement of any kind aggravates\nthis condition. In general, recently delivered patients must be kept\nquiet no matter how well they feel. A few hours of sleep, or, at\nleast, of repose, are justified by the fatigue incident to labor, and\nnothing should be permitted to interfere with it.\n\nMETHODS OF REVIVING THE CHILD.--Complications which interfere with\nthe child's vitality rarely occur when labor proceeds so rapidly that\nthere is not time to get a doctor. Nevertheless a description of\nchild-birth would be incomplete without reference to the measures\nintended to revive asphyxiated infants.\n\nSuch measures aim, first of all, to make the infant breathe for\nitself, and if breathing does not begin promptly we resort to\nartificial respiration. Mucus in the mouth or in the lower air-\npassages hinders the entrance of air into the lungs; consequently it\nis the duty of the attendant to remove this mucus by means of gauze\nor some light fabric wrapped about a finger and passed backward over\nthe tongue. In most cases nothing else will be necessary. But if\nbreathing is not immediately established, the child should be grasped\nby the feet with one hand and held downward while its back is\nvigorously slapped with the other. Usually, it gasps at once; when it\ndoes not, the attendant may stroke its face and chest with her hand,\nwhich has been previously held in cold water for a moment; or she may\ndash a handful of cold water upon its body. With very rare exceptions\nthese procedures make the child cry.\n\nOne must always be alert to see the very first attempt at breathing,\nfor unduly prolonged manipulations may defeat their own object; the\nnatural inclination always is to do too much rather than not enough.\nIn some instances, however, the measures thus far indicated will not\nprove successful, and, if not, the cord must be tied and cut through,\nfor subsequent treatment cannot be conveniently carried out while the\nchild remains attached to the placenta. As soon as the cord is\nsevered the child is placed in a tub of warm water, about the normal\ntemperature of the body, and is moved about in the bath for a few\nmoments, the attendant watching closely all the while, for the\nbreathing is often very superficial. Should signs of beginning\nrespiration not appear, the attendant should grasp the child by the\nshoulders, dip it up to the neck in a basin of cold water and quickly\nreturn it to the warm tub. This operation may be repeated five or six\ntimes; generally the instant the child touches the cold water it\ndraws up its feet, opens its eyes, and cries. One must take care that\nthe plunge lasts but a moment; if the child becomes chilled efforts\nto revive it will likely be unsuccessful. Indeed, the necessity for\nkeeping it warm must be constantly borne in mind.\n\nWith the very exceptional cases in which hot and cold tubs are\nineffective, the following method becomes valuable. Wrap the child in\na blanket and lay it face downward upon a table or chair, allowing\nthe head to hang over the edge. Roll the body on one side or a little\nbeyond; then slowly roll it back upon its face and onward to the\nother side. This maneuver is repeated fourteen times to the minute,\nbut not more frequently. When properly performed it secures a flow of\nair to and from the lungs with the same rapidity as in the normal\nrespiration of an infant. Efforts to revive the child must not be\nquickly given up, as a successful outcome occasionally requires half\nan hour of work or even longer. One method after another should be\ntried in the order which I have indicated. A physician always\nperseveres so long as the heart-sounds can be heard; but, since an\ninexperienced person might be unable to decide upon this point, the\nmost reliable course for the layman is to persist in the\nresuscitation until the physician arrives.",

No preliminary examination was\nthought necessary, and after the delivery visits were not made unless\nthe family became alarmed and requested them. When thus asked to come\nback the physician sometimes found that an infection had developed;\noccasionally the breasts were giving trouble, or some other\ndifficulty in the care of the mother or of the infant was baffling\nthe nurse. It is now recognized that the medical attendant should not\nwait for the appearance of untoward symptoms. Although the strict\nobservance of the various precautions which I have already emphasized\nshould lead and usually do lead to an uneventful convalescence, it is\nnone the less true that the danger of infection and of other\nimmediate complication has not passed until several weeks after\ndelivery. For this reason and also because skillful guidance of the\nmother at this time will prevent unwelcome sequels in the later years\nof life, physicians now extend their watchfulness beyond the hour of\nbirth. The number of visits ordinarily required is not large. In each\ncase, to be sure, the circumstances will determine the number; but,\nas a rule, ten visits, if properly distributed, will be sufficient.\nDuring the month succeeding delivery these visits should be made in\nabout this order: a daily visit for the first five days, subsequently\none upon the seventh, the tenth, the fourteenth, the twenty-first,\nand the twenty-eighth day.\n\nAt the conclusion of labor there begins a series of changes which are\nthe reverse of those incident to pregnancy, and which restore the\nbody to its original condition. Six weeks are generally required for\nthese alterations. They should leave the mother in _perfect_\nhealth, but traces of pregnancy are not entirely effaced; even in the\nabsence of outward evidence, if a woman has ever given birth to a\nchild a thorough internal examination will disclose the fact.\n\nThe initial steps in these restorative processes are taken most\npromptly and effectively when patients remain in bed. The traditional\ncustom of doing so has given to the first few weeks following\ndelivery the popular name, \"the Lying-in Period.\" To these weeks\nphysicians usually apply the technical term _puerperium_, the\nchild's period, a designation which brings to mind the secretion of\nmilk which, though not a retrogressive change, is, nevertheless, one\nof the most distinctive results of childbirth.\n\nRadical as the bodily changes in progress at this time are, the\nlying-in period is not a period of illness. But there is, perhaps, no\nother time in a woman's life when she may cross the boundary between\nsickness and health so easily; for here nature tolerates no trifling.\nNot infrequently puerperal patients who are feeling well attempt too\nmuch, and suffer a more or less serious set-back; it is an all-\nimportant duty of the obstetrician, therefore, to restrain them from\nharmful activity. In my experience patients yield to restraint most\nreadily, and secure the best results, if I explain to them the\nanatomical facts which should guide the management of the lying-in\nperiod.\n\nTHE CHANGES IN THE UTERUS.--Since of all the organs the uterus\nundergoes during pregnancy the most extensive development, it also\nholds the place of prominence during the lying-in period. Immediately\nafter delivery the womb weighs two pounds and measures some eight\ninches in height, five in breadth, and four in thickness. In the\ncourse of a few days it begins to dwindle in size, gradually sinking\nin the abdomen until it lies entirely within the pelvic cavity.\nToward the end of five or six weeks it resumes the position occupied\nbefore conception, regains approximately its original dimensions, and\nweighs two ounces. We speak of the process which leads to these\nresults as the _involution_ of the uterus. Since a great deal\ndepends upon the rapidity with which involution progresses, we must\nunderstand just what it is and how it may be influenced.\n\nThe muscle of the womb, to which this property of involution belongs,\nis an aggregation of thousands of individual fibers. In response to\nexcellent nutrition during pregnancy, these fibers have grown thick\nand strong, in order that they may furnish the power needed at the\ntime of labor. When this purpose has been fulfilled each fiber\nbecomes smaller and gradually passes into a resting stage the better\nto preserve its vigor. It is the shrivelling of the individual\nfibers, therefore, which accounts for the total reduction in the size\nof the womb.\n\nAlthough the source of the stimulus which causes the muscle-fibers to\natrophy is not so clear as we should like it, we are acquainted with\ncertain influences to which involution is susceptible. Of these none\nmerits so much attention as the influence of the breasts. The\nintimate relation between the breasts and the uterus manifests itself\nin such a variety of ways and with such force that no one doubts its\nexistence. Thus, if a nursing mother becomes pregnant her infant is\nusually deprived of sufficient nourishment or suffers some digestive\ndisturbance; if not, and the mother, ignorant of her condition,\ncontinues with the breast feeding, she may jeopardize the newly begun\npregnancy. Very likely she will be warned of the fact by the signs of\nthreatened miscarriage. More frequently, but in quite the same way,\nwe find that nursing causes uterine contractions in the early part of\nthe lying-in period, when they are called after-pains. Women who\nexperience them tell us they are more severe while the infant nurses;\nand they also say that the discomfort disappears after several days,\na fact which indicates that involution has made notable headway. The\nphysician is not dependent on such evidence, however; for a simple\nexamination reveals at any time how far involution has progressed. By\nthis means we have learned that nursing facilitates the involution\nprocess. On the other hand, it is found to be true, as we should\nnaturally expect, that women who decline to suckle the infant recover\nfrom childbirth somewhat less rapidly than those who follow nature's\nplan. In this fact, therefore, is found a selfish motive, yet a very\ngood one, which should impel mothers to perform this exceedingly\nimportant duty.\n\nAside from the change in the mass of the uterus, notable results of\ninvolution relate to its mouth and to its ligaments, for these\nstructures are also chiefly muscle. The mouth of the womb, lately\nstretched to permit the exit of the child, gapes widely for a time;\nbut ultimately its lips are drawn together, the tissues which compose\nthem stiffen, and the canal which they enclose is narrowed to almost\nmicroscopical dimensions. When involution is complete, the uterus has\nso far regained its virginal character that no trace of childbirth\nremains other than a few small fissures in the margin of its mouth.\n\nIt is the office of the ligaments to hold the uterus in proper\nposition. In consequence of pregnancy they have been stretched, and,\nas we might anticipate, after the contents of the womb are expelled\nthe ligaments hang loosely from its sides, very much as sails hang\nwhen a breeze dies down. Immediately after delivery, therefore, the\nligaments give the womb little or no support; eventually they shorten\nand tighten, readily accommodating themselves to the existing\nconditions. Until the accommodation is perfected, it is especially\ndesirable to permit no pressure which might push the womb backward.\nIt is for this reason that many obstetricians object to the time-\nhonored custom of applying a tight bandage about the abdomen at the\nconclusion of labor; for, though bandaging is not always harmful, it\nhas a distinct tendency to misplace the womb. A friend who has served\nas an assistant in one clinic where patients were bandaged regularly\nand in another where they were not, tells me that displacements of\nthe womb were much more common among women treated by the former\nmethod.\n\nWhile the process of involution is altering the shape and size of the\nwomb, other forces are at work within the organ to provide its cavity\nwith a new mucous membrane. In character and in extent the inner\nsurface of the womb, left raw and bleeding at the conclusion of\nlabor, is comparable to the wound which would result if some accident\nremoved the skin from the palms of both hands. No one would question\nthe wisdom of guarding such an injury to the hands; but cleanliness\nis even more necessary to the prompt and healthful restoration of the\nuterine mucous membrane. However, the wound within the uterus is so\nfar from the surface of the body that it need not be directly covered\nwith a surgical dressing; sterile pads are kept over the vulva to\nexclude contaminating material until the healing is completed. Since\nbleeding ceases after that point is reached, we have no difficulty in\nknowing when the mucous membrane has been restored.\n\nTHE LOCHIA.--The vaginal discharge which regularly follows the\ntermination of pregnancy gets its name from the Greek word\n_lochia_. At first the discharge is pure blood, because it\nissues exclusively from the vessels left open by the removal of the\nafter-birth. The greater part of the blood flows out of the birth\ncanal, but frequently some of it collects in the cavity of the uterus\nor of the vagina; there it coagulates, and the clots may not be\nexpelled until several days later. In that event, as whatever effect\nthe bleeding may have had has long since passed, the appearance of\nthe clots is usually no occasion for alarm.\n\nThe amount of lochia varies, and will likely fall below the average\nin small or anemic women and rise above it in those who are large or\nrobust. Then again, the discharge is less profuse if considerable\nblood has been lost immediately after the labor. For the first ten\ndays the total quantity seldom exceeds eight or ten ounces; after\nthat time it is so small that it cannot be accurately estimated.\nFormerly much larger amounts were considered normal, and, therefore,\nit is probable that modern aseptic treatment of child-birth has\nlessened the subsequent loss of blood. Toward the end of a week the\nlochia changes from a bright red to a brownish color, because the\ndischarge now includes certain products of disintegration. Somewhat\nlater the lochia consists almost entirely of mucus, being only\nstreaked with blood; but there will be an increase in the bleeding\nwhen the patient gets up; and injudicious activity may cause\nflooding. A slight bloody discharge may be expected to continue until\nfive or six weeks after the child was born.\n\nA faint but characteristic odor to the lochia proves very\ndisagreeable to some patients, and on that account it was formerly\ncustomary to give them a daily douche throughout the lying-in period.\nThis was before the characteristics of the puerperal uterus and the\nnature of infection were thoroughly understood. Most physicians are\nnow convinced that the early use of douches is rarely beneficial; and\nsince there is danger of washing infectious material from the lower\npart of the vagina into the uterus, they may, if given prior to the\nsecond week after delivery, actually do harm. Consequently douches\nare not now used in a routine way. Whenever irrigations are indicated\nthe doctor will prescribe them. Late in the puerperium vaginal\ndouches are unobjectionable, and patients may take them unassisted,\nfor then the fluid will not penetrate the womb so long as it has a\nfree escape from the outlet of the vagina. Moreover, it is immaterial\nif some of the fluid should pass into the womb, for its lining will\nhave been largely restored by this time, and at points where\nrestoration is incomplete defenses have been thrown up against\ninfection.\n\nTHE RETURN OF MENSTRUATION.--On account of the dilatation at the time\nof labor women who have previously suffered with menstruation may\nlook forward to relief after child-birth. Menstruation generally\nbecomes as painless as the flow of the lochia; and so far as a\npatient can tell the two phenomena are identical. Actually, however,\nthey bear no relation to each other. The fact that the cavity of the\nuterus has been deprived of its lining is responsible for the lochia,\nwhereas the menstrual discharge occurs in spite of the lining,\nthrough which it breaks at regular intervals in response to a\nstimulus that is absent for a longer or shorter period after the\nbirth of a child.\n\nIn the latter part of the puerperium there may be doubt as to whether\na discharge is menstrual or lochial; though, if necessary, an\nexamination of the interior of the womb would always settle the\nquestion, for structural changes in the uterine mucous membrane form\nthe most characteristic feature of menstruation. If, therefore, small\nbits of this tissue are removed and studied under the microscope, a\ndefinite conclusion can be reached. Physicians may resort to such an\nexamination when the significance of a discharge is not clear without\nit; but other evidence usually enables them to decide the matter.\n\nThe secretion of milk often exerts an influence upon the\nreestablishment of menstruation. Under ideal circumstances the mother\ndoes not menstruate while she nurses her infant; whereas, if the\nbreasts are not in use, the menstrual function returns six to eight\nweeks after delivery. Other pertinent clinical facts also lend weight\nto the opinion that the activity of the breasts, more technically\ncalled lactation, should not only prevent menstruation but also\nhinder the ripening of egg-cells in the ovary. Thus, the nursing\ninfant has a potent influence upon the reproductive function of its\nmother, enabling it to preserve its food supply; for in the event of\nconception the milk usually decreases in amount or becomes of an\ninferior quality. To secure this protective influence should prove a\nstrong incentive for the mother to nurse her child; in barely half\nthe cases, however, is it effective throughout a year. One-third of\nnursing mothers, statistics indicate, begin to menstruate about two\nmonths after delivery, and month by month the proportion gradually\nincreases.\n\nSince menstruation appears so frequently during lactation, it cannot\nbe considered abnormal. It does not follow that the function will\nbecome permanently reestablished after a patient has menstruated\nonce; in many instances several months elapse before there is another\nperiod, and in a few cases there will be only one period during the\nyear the child suckles. Nevertheless, when the function has once made\nits appearance extraordinary precaution should be exercised to avert\na return, and about the time its reappearance would be expected the\nwoman should go to bed for several days. Although this measure may\nprove futile, we know of no other so likely to prove successful.\n\nMenstruation is more apt to return prematurely after the birth of the\nfirst child than of later ones. This may be due in part to a kind of\naccommodation of the maternal organism to the reproductive process as\none pregnancy follows another; but I am convinced that it is also due\nin part to the greater physical and mental composure of experienced\nmothers. Until a woman has learned the unwelcome consequences she is\napt to take over household duties before she is equal to the task, or\nshe may engage in too strenuous amusements; and most mothers err in a\ntoo energetic care of the baby.\n\nOTHER RESTORATIVE CHANGES.--Many of the restorative changes in the\nmother's body are either so intricate or so devoid of practical\nsignificance that we may pass them by; though all of them have great\ninterest for the specialist, and some have occasioned bitter\ncontroversy. The alterations in the heart, for instance, have been\nthe subject of a prolonged dispute between French and German\nscientists. The former still assert that this organ regularly\nenlarges during pregnancy and subsequently returns to its normal\nsize. The Germans deny both these contentions. Certainly the\nalterations are insignificant from a practical standpoint; otherwise\ncompetent observers would not disagree.\n\nThe really important changes in the body, other than those pertaining\nto the uterus, are familiar to women who have passed through\npregnancy; but other prospective mothers may not understand that they\nwill regain the bodily condition which existed before conception.\n\n_Loss in Weight_.--While the weight lost during the lying-in\nperiod is not so vital as some other alterations, many have a keen\ninterest in it. In addition to the loss of ten to fifteen pounds at\nthe time of birth, a further loss occurs in the course of a few\nweeks. Diminution in the size of the uterus is responsible for the\nloss of nearly two pounds, and the lochial discharge for at least\nanother; but the chief factor concerned is the removal of water from\nthe tissues, many of which have become dropsical toward the end of\npregnancy. Altogether patients do not lose less than ten pounds\nduring the lying-in period, and often lose a great deal more. The\naverage loss for the first week alone is said to equal one-twelfth of\nthe patient's weight at the conclusion of labor; the total loss for\nthe whole of the puerperium corresponds to one-tenth of her weight at\nthe beginning of it. Variations from the rule are attributed to\nindividual peculiarities of nutrition. In general, stout women lose\nmore than slender ones, but with all types the loss is greater if the\nmother nurses her infant. On the other hand, a generous diet tends to\ncounteract any loss in weight whatever.\n\n_The Abdominal Wall_.--Much more important than the question of\nweight is the recovery of the abdominal wall from the strain imposed\nby the enlargement of the womb. In normal cases, to be sure, there is\nvery slight disproportion between the size of the pregnant uterus at\nterm and the capacity of the abdomen, yet the abdominal wall\ninvariably suffers a little stretching and unless it retains its\nelasticity, the viscera are deprived of essential support, and cause\nmore or less discomfort.\n\nThe restorative changes in the abdominal wall involve the skin, the\nfatty tissues, and the muscles. As soon as the distention has been\nrelieved the skin falls into folds, less noticeable if the pregnancy\nwas the first; and the muscles become so flabby that one has no\ndifficulty in pushing the wall backward until it touches the tissues\nwhich cover the spinal column. Within a few weeks, if all goes well,\nthe muscles regain their \"tone.\" Coincidently, the excessive fat over\nthe abdomen is absorbed. The skin becomes smooth, and its\npigmentation fades completely; but the pregnancy streaks rarely\nvanish entirely, although they always become very much less\nnoticeable.\n\nWhether or not the abdominal wall will recover from the distention of\npregnancy depends entirely upon the muscles. As the lying-in period\nadvances each fiber should gradually shorten until the whole muscular\nstructure becomes as firm and tight as it ever was. But this takes\ntime, and no artifice can hasten the repair. Perfect recovery is most\nlikely with the body in a recumbent position, which relieves the\nmuscles from any strain. These facts are better appreciated than\nformerly, hence most physicians encourage their obstetrical patients\nto remain in bed somewhat longer than their mothers did. Generally\nnothing else will be required, and only under extraordinary\ncircumstances will nature need assistance. Thus, if there has been\nunusual distention, as, for example, that due to twins, the muscular\nimpairment may be extreme; or if pregnancies follow one another in\nquick succession the strain becomes so nearly continuous that there\nis not sufficient time for adequate repair. Whenever nature does need\nencouragement calisthenics of some kind are advisable. These\nsystematic exercises, which the patient practices in bed and flat on\nher back, are usually begun about a week after delivery, though there\nmay be some reason for beginning them earlier or later than this.\n\nThe physician will always select the proper calisthenics, but the\nfollowing \"movements\" generally prove satisfactory. To exercise the\nmuscles at the front of the abdomen one leg after the other is raised\nand lowered; as this is being done the knee will be bent (flexed) at\nfirst, but later the leg may be held straight (extended). Other\nmuscles come into play when the feet are alternately brought together\nand separated as widely as possible. A third movement which exercises\nthe muscles at the side of the abdomen consists in raising the\nshoulders from the bed and twisting the trunk so that the weight of\nthe chest rests now on the right, now on the left elbow. When these\nmovements can be performed fifteen or twenty minutes without fatigue\nmore vigorous exercises may be adopted. For example, the buttocks,\ntogether with the lower part of the back, are raised off the bed,\nwhile the shoulders, elbows, and the heels remain stationary. A day\nor so before getting up the patient should practice alternately\nraising herself from the recumbent to the sitting posture and\nreturning to the above position without assistance from the arms.\n\nThe value of bandaging the abdomen immediately after delivery as a\nmeans of strengthening the abdominal muscles is questionable; though\nphysicians agree to the advantages of a supporter after patients are\nout of bed. We constantly see perfect restoration of these muscles\nwithout the early use of a binder; in fact, women who have employed\nit throughout the lying-in period do not secure an efficient\nabdominal wall more frequently than others who began its use two\nweeks after they were delivered. Even those physicians who advocate\nan early application of the binder concede that it works harm in\ncertain cases and do not recommend it indiscriminately.\n\nThose who postpone for a fortnight the use of the binder will escape\nthe tendency it has to cause displacements. By this time the\ninvolution will have advanced so far that the womb lies within the\npelvic cavity, where it is surrounded by the hip bones, which protect\nit from external forces that otherwise would influence its position.\nWhen permitted to get up patients ought to use a binder, because it\ncounteracts the feeling of \"falling to pieces\" of which some complain\nwhen the abdominal walls are not comfortably supported. But there is\nno evidence to show that a binder plays any part in restoring the\nfigure. When, in spite of ample rest, the abdominal muscles fail to\nrecover completely, we have no better way of strengthening them than\nby use of calisthenics or massage.\n\n_The Pelvic Floor_.--Second only in importance to having the\nwomb restored to its original position is the necessity of\nrestoration of the pelvic floor. This structure, also called the\n_perineum_, we should know, lies between the thighs, shuts in\nthe bottom of the abdomen, and prevents prolapse of the viscera. In\nwomen it forms the lower portion of the birth-canal, enclosing the\naperture through which the child enters the world. Although\nintelligent management of labor is of the greatest value for the\nprotection of the pelvic floor, under certain circumstances it may be\nimpossible to preserve it intact; injury to it is the rule when the\nfirst child is born, and not unusual in later births. There can be no\ndoubt regarding the advisability of uniting the edges of a tear;\nindeed, to do so immediately is the very first essential toward\nrestoring the pelvic floor to its wonted integrity. But even though\ntears are sewn up successfully, there is invariably some relaxation\nof the perineum until the restorative process, which here again\nchiefly concerns the muscles, has been given opportunity to become\neffective.\n\nAs with all the restorative changes in the lying-in period, to rest\ncalmly in bed favors the perfect recovery of the pelvic floor more\nthan anything else. Keeping the thighs together during the first few\ndays undoubtedly assists tears in healing, but that precaution is not\nalways necessary, and when it is the physician will call attention to\nthe fact. The really important matter, as I have said, is that the\nupright position should not be resumed until the pelvic floor has\nbecome firm.\n\nTHE CARE OF THE PATIENT.--Now we have learned enough of the manifold\nchanges in the lying-in period to appreciate the fact that patients\nrequire medical direction even though they are feeling perfectly\nwell. The view held by former generations that women can get along\nwithout a doctor and with any sort of nursing is partly responsible\nfor the existence of gynecology, the branch of medicine which deals\nwith the diseases of women. Recently delivered women should be\ntreated as surgical patients, not because they are ill, but to keep\nthem from becoming so.\n\nIf the patient desires the highest degree of protection an\nexperienced nurse is indispensable, for she will make systematic\nobservations which would consume too much of the doctor's time for\nhis personal attention, yet without which he would not be\nsufficiently conversant with his patient's condition to guide her\nproperly. The temperature, the rate of the pulse, and of the\nrespiration should be recorded at regular intervals during the day\nand night. An elevation of temperature at the conclusion of labor\nneed give no uneasiness, for experience has shown that it generally\nsubsides within a few hours. Moreover, slight elevations in the\ncourse of the following week are so frequent that obstetricians have\nagreed to regard as a normal temperature for this period 100.4\ndegrees instead of the usual normal of 98.4 degrees. The pulse-rate\nmost frequently does not depart from what is characteristic for the\nindividual, though about one-fifth of puerperal women have a slowing\nof the pulse, a phenomenon of favorable significance. Any difficulty\nin breathing that may have existed in the latter part of pregnancy\ndisappears when the abdominal distention is relieved, and the\nrespiratory rate becomes normal. So long as the body is getting rid\nof the tissue-substance essential to pregnancy, but now without any\npurpose, more than the usual amount of waste material is present in\nthe expired air.\n\n_The Elimination of Waste Material_.--As we might expect from\nthe loss in body weight, the excretory organs are particularly active\nduring the lying-in period. In quantity the loss of water exceeds all\nthe other waste-products together; and pronounced activity of the\nkidneys or of the sweat glands may become a source of annoyance.\nSince it is undesirable to interfere with these functions, whatever\ninconvenience either may cause will be borne with less complaint if\nthe patient understands that a large loss of water at this time\nindicates a healthful condition of the body.\n\nShortly after delivery there may be difficulty in emptying the\nbladder; and, under such circumstances, the doctor or nurse used to\ncatheterize the patient immediately; this habit once begun, it was\noften necessary to repeat the operation day after day, or, for that\nmatter, several times a day. But as physicians came to know more of\nthe relations of bacteria to inflammation of the bladder, they grew\nmore cautious, and preferred to wait a long time before resorting to\nthe catheter. The reward of this patience was to find that, with\nremarkably few exceptions, puerperal women ultimately void of their\nown accord. Accordingly catheterization after child-birth is now\npostponed, and is never performed until a number of devices to get\nthe patient to void spontaneously have been tried without success.\nOften urination follows putting a hot-water bottle over the bladder;\nor pouring warm water over the vulva; or placing the patient upon a\nbed-pan from which steam is rising. When these and other devices well\nknown to every nurse are not effective, catheterization becomes\nnecessary. With the elaborate precautions taken to avoid infection of\nthe bladder, catheterization is now performed with very slight risk.\n\nConstipation, for various reasons, becomes a regular feature of the\nlying-in period. The confinement in bed, restricted diet, relaxation\nof the abdominal wall, and sensitiveness about the region of the\nrectum, all have a tendency to prevent spontaneous movements of the\nbowels. As one of these influences after another is removed the\nbowels begin to act naturally. Childbirth may cause chronic\nconstipation, but this sequel would occur much less often if a little\ncare were taken to prevent it.\n\nThe routine use of enemas deserves to be condemned. I see no\nobjection to an occasional enema if purgative medicine has been taken\nwithout effect, but constant use of them, more than likely, will\nresult in the enema habit. Similarly, long-continued administration\nof strong purgatives tends to make them a permanent necessity. While\nin bed if medicine is taken every other day the bowels will have\nopportunity on the intervening days to move spontaneously, though we\ndo not really expect them to move naturally until six or eight weeks\nafter the delivery, when the patient is able to take as much exercise\nas she likes. Toward the end of the second week, however, mild\nlaxatives generally prove effective, and it is important to select\none the dose of which may be gradually decreased. Senna prunes, which\nwere described in Chapter V, fill the purpose very well. Six or eight\nof them may be needed at first, but the number may be gradually\nreduced, until finally none are necessary.\n\n_Cleanliness_.--In view of the excessive elimination of waste\nproducts from the body, the maintenance of cleanliness during the\nlying-in period may require the use of a large amount of linen.\nOccasionally patients perspire so freely that the night clothes have\nto be changed several times in twenty-four hours, and the bed linen\nonly a little less frequently. But at any cost it is imperative not\nto hinder but rather to promote this function and to keep the skin in\na healthful condition through bathing and massage. Nurses are taught,\non this account, to give a warm soap and water bed-bath in the\nmorning and an alcohol rub at night. Patients are usually allowed to\ntake tub-baths after the third week.\n\nLocal cleanliness, which is a matter of the very first importance,\ncan only be attained through bathing the vulva with an antiseptic\nsolution and the use of sterile pads. At first the pads are changed\nvery frequently, but after the discharge becomes less profuse they\nare renewed at intervals of four to six hours.\n\n_The Diet_.--For the first week of the lying-in period not all\npatients are given the same diet, and the physician always leaves\nspecific directions regarding it. Generally the diet consists of\nliquids, such as milk and broths, for a couple of days; under some\ncircumstances liquid nourishment is continued longer. As the appetite\nincreases easily digestible but nutritious food is added, and before\nlong the patient resumes her ordinary diet.\n\nThe modern tendency is to give solid food and to give it in\nsubstantial amounts much earlier than was once customary;\nrestrictions, none the less, are still observed so long as the\npatient remains in bed. With the body at rest, its food requirements\nare diminished and hearty meals are unnecessary. If convalescence\nproceeds satisfactorily such wide latitude in the choice of food is\npermissible that the nurse may regulate the diet, consulting the\nphysician whenever necessary.\n\n_The Environment_.--A large, bright room that can be quickly\nheated and easily ventilated adds notably to the comfort of the\nlying-in period. The windows may be opened through the greater part\nof the day and at night should always be left so. To make thorough\nairing of the apartment more feasible and to protect the mother from\nannoyance when the baby cries, it is more satisfactory to have the\nbaby occupy an adjoining room where the nurse sleeps within call.\nUnder any circumstances some arrangement must be made so that the\nmother's rest at night will not be broken needlessly.\n\nNo pains should be spared to keep the patient quiet for at least ten\ndays. Household cares and petty worries materially delay\nconvalescence. During this period only a limited number of the\nimmediate members of her family ought to see her, and their visits\nshould be brief. Unfortunately, if too many relatives and friends\nvisit her a number of questions will be repeatedly asked which are\ndecidedly wearing on any patient.\n\n_The Time for Getting Up_.--How long a woman should stay in bed\nafter the birth of a child is a question which has given rise to\nprolonged discussion. The majority of obstetricians adhere to the\ntraditional ten days; but there are advocates of a longer period and\nadvocates of a shorter one. The generalizations of many writers upon\nthis subject are too sweeping, for exceptions may be found to any\nrule. Each patient is best counselled when the advice given is based\nupon her own condition and particularly upon the progress made in the\ninvolution of the uterus, which does not advance with the same\nrapidity in all cases.\n\nMore or less in imitation of the custom among savages, Charles White,\nin 1776, recommended that women should not remain in bed longer than\na day or two after child-birth. Very likely the inadaptability of the\nmethod to civilized women soon became apparent; at any rate his\nsuggestion was not widely adopted, and had been completely forgotten\nuntil a few years ago, when the custom was revived in one of the\nGerman clinics. The innovation met with violent opposition in Europe,\nand, so far as I know, has found but scant favor in America.\n\nGenerally patients are allowed to sit up in bed toward the end of the\nfirst week, but if there are stitches, sitting up is deferred until\nten days or later, when the stitches have been removed. Under the\nmost favorable circumstances, however, sitting up in bed becomes\nwearisome, for the weight of the body does not fall upon the spine,\nas it should; and besides the extended position of the legs is\nfatiguing. No one should force herself to keep this posture, for at\nbest it does no more than relieve monotony. The exercises previously\nsuggested prepare her much more effectually for getting upon her\nfeet.\n\nBetween the tenth and the fifteenth day patients may leave the bed\nand sit quietly in a chair. The condition of the uterus, the\ncharacter of the lochia, and the firmness of the pelvic floor will\ndetermine the day, but usually it proves wiser to defer it until\nfully two weeks have lapsed. As a rule, the patient remains out of\nbed an hour the first day, two the second, three the third, and so on\nuntil she is up all day. She should not attempt to walk until the\nsecond or third day. At first she should take only a few steps, but\ngradually she may increase the number and finally walk with freedom\nand ease. Several reasons make it advisable for patients to remain\nfour weeks on the floor where they have been confined; going up and\ndown stairs is especially tiresome, and, of still greater importance,\npatients pass from the doctor's control as soon as they go down\nstairs. For fear of overtaxing the strength none of the household\ncares should be assumed before the fourth week, and not all of them\nthen, for women are not capable of resuming their accustomed duties\nfully until the sixth week; and some are not strong enough to do so\nuntil a somewhat later date.\n\nSince patients generally feel well during the lying-in period they\nare apt to object to remaining in bed two weeks. Most of them\nacquiesce as soon as they understand the organic changes in progress\nand appreciate the lasting benefits of a temporary forbearance, but a\nfew must be made to realize that very serious penalties may be\nattached to undue haste. For the latter it might be better if the\nalarming consequences of getting up too early--discomfort,\nhemorrhage, and collapse--occurred more frequently than they do. As\nit happens, the ill-effects of such indiscretion are not usually felt\nimmediately; when too late the lesson is learned that many of the\noperations upon women in the later years of life are dependent on\nimprudent conduct just after the first child was born.\n\nTHE FINAL EXAMINATION.--Looking to complete restoration of the\nwoman's health, the modern management of obstetrical cases breaks\ndecisively with tradition at three points. An utter disregard of\nprecaution has given way to very careful preparations before and at\nthe time of labor; definite rules for the management of the lying-in\nperiod are carried out under the supervision of the physician; and\nfinally, prompted by the same impulse, the physician examines his\nobstetrical patients before discharging them. Satisfactory conditions\nare generally found; if they are, it is a great comfort to be assured\nof the fact; and if not, timely treatment of the abnormality may\nreadily correct it; with delay, on the other hand, treatment often\nbecomes more formidable.\n\nThe end of the fourth week of the lying-in period proves a convenient\ntime for this examination. As yet the restorative changes in the\nreproductive organs have not been completed, but one may definitely\nsay by this time whether or not they will culminate in a satisfactory\nmanner. Besides, making the examination while the changes are in\nprogress sometimes enables the physician to treat approaching\ncomplications before they actually develop. Thus, when the pelvic\nfloor has not regained its strength sufficiently, the patient will be\nadvised to forego the liberty in moving about ordinarily granted at\nthis time. When the womb inclines to an improper position, a\ntemporary support may be introduced to hold it where it belongs;\nlater, upon removing the device, the womb usually retains a good\nposition. Again, there are conditions which a douche will relieve,\nand still others benefited by medicinal treatment. If an abnormality\nis recognized which cannot at once be treated to the best advantage,\narrangements will be made for such prompt treatment that the woman\nwill not become an invalid. Instead of placing obstacles in the way,\npatients should rather insist upon this examination, for it is\nimportant in guarding their future health.\n\nNow and then patients are kept under observation for a longer period,\nbut, as a rule, they are discharged as well as examined at the end of\nfour weeks. They may also discard the abdominal binder about this\ntime and put on corsets, which, however, should not be tightly worn.\nAlthough thrown upon her own resources from this moment, the patient\nwill clearly understand that she must continue to exercise sound\ndiscrimination in what she does. And here, of course, we encounter\nthe greatest difficulty in offering practical advice, for what one\nmay do easily will overtax another. Generally speaking, going up and\ndown stairs more than once a day is inadvisable until another two\nweeks have passed. Likewise the mother who would adopt a conservative\npolicy will not take full charge of her baby before it is six weeks\nold, though there can be no objection if she wishes to direct its\ncare. The same advice applies to running the household. Over-\nexertion, no matter what the source, delays convalescence from child-\nbirth to such an extent that the safe plan is always to err on the\nside of doing too little, rather than to run the risk of doing too\nmuch.",

        "content": "THE NURSING MOTHER\n\nThe Breasts--Human Milk--The Technique of Nursing--Hygiene of the\nMother: Diet; Psychic Influence; Recreation and Rest--The\nSupplementary Bottle--Weaning.\n\n\nWhen the obstetrician pays his final visit the mother usually has\nready a number of questions, most of which anticipate difficulties in\nthe care of the baby. At that time, however, minute and far-reaching\ndirections cannot always be given. Unforeseen peculiarities in the\ndevelopment of the child may modify such general principles for the\nmanagement of infants as could be laid down in advance. With a few\nexceptions, therefore, mothers require during the early years of a\nbaby's life skilled advice as to his upbringing--advice for which\nneither instinct nor haphazard counsel is a safe substitute. It is an\nexcellent plan, and one which is becoming more and more popular, to\nhave a physician supervise the care of the baby through the period of\nmost active growth. According to this plan, the mother, even though\nher baby is well and developing as it should, consults the physician\nat regular intervals, once a month for example, and upon these\noccasions secures help in solving problems which are certain to\npresent themselves. Such an arrangement shows a merited appreciation\nof the proverbial \"ounce of prevention,\" and when serious\ndifficulties do arise materially counteracts the tendency to panic\nwhich is exhibited by so many young mothers.\n\nAmong the problems which the mother must solve, that of nutrition\noutranks all others in importance; and unless the infant is nourished\nwith human milk, it also exceeds them in perplexity. For, although\ngreat advances have been made in artificial feeding, science has not\nyet removed all the intricacies and dangers involved in the use of\nthe bottle. On the other hand, mothers who nurse their babies rarely\nmeet with difficulty. Human milk is perfectly adapted to the wants of\nthe infant; and all substitutes, though carefully designed to\nduplicate it, are only partially successful. We have learned how to\nmodify cow's milk so that in chemical constituents, at least, it is a\nvery close imitation of human milk; but human milk possesses, in\naddition to its chemical properties, other desirable qualities which\ncannot be instilled into an artificial food. We must agree,\ntherefore, that attempts to disseminate a wider knowledge of the\ncorrect principles of bottle-feeding do not have the highest aim. Our\nreal need is a vastly greater proportion of women who nurse their\nchildren.\n\nTHE BREASTS.--For success in nursing the first essential is healthful\nbreasts. With this the largeness or smallness of a breast has nothing\nto do, for size is no more an index of its capacity for producing\nmilk than is the weight of a woman an index of her energy. The breast\nis not a warehouse, but a factory, with very limited storage capacity\nfor its product. Differences of size are generally to be explained by\nthe variable amount of fatty-tissue the breast contains. And so far\nas the secretion of milk is concerned the fat is entirely passive; it\nfills in the space between the glandular elements; and a layer of fat\njust beneath the skin protects the glands against external influences\nthat otherwise might disturb their activity. Stripped of their fatty\nenvelope the structures which actually secrete the milk and convey it\nto the nipple resemble a miniature cluster of grapes. Each tiny,\nspherical gland corresponds to one of the grapes and contains a\ncavity lined with cells which manufacture the milk. From this cavity\nthe milk flows through a microscopic tube which unites with similar\ntubes to form a larger one; this in turn joins others of its kind;\nand so on, until ultimately the milk enters a relatively large duct--\nthe figurative stem of the cluster--which conducts the milk to its\ndestination. There are from ten to fifteen of these terminal ducts;\neach drains a separate group of glands, but all end in the nipple.\n\nShortly after conception the breasts become congested; in consequence\nthey enlarge, become tender, and begin to show swollen veins beneath\nthe skin. The most significant alteration, however, occurs in the\ncells which line the glands; these increase in size at first; and\nthen, by a process of cell division, their number multiplies. After\npregnancy has advanced six to eight weeks these cells begin to\nelaborate the thin, watery fluid called colostrum. Contrary to\npopular belief, the quantity of colostrum is not prophetic of the\ncharacter of the milk; there is no ill-omen, to be sure, in a\nplentiful secretion, but a meager one is quite as likely to be\nfollowed by successful lactation. At present we are unable to predict\nby any means either the quantity or the quality of the milk which a\nprospective mother will produce.\n\nSome writers contend that influences which come into play during\ngirlhood ultimately affect the capacity of the breast for making\nmilk; for example, irregular habits in youth and the wearing of\nimproper styles of clothing are said to be particularly detrimental\ninfluences. Of course, a healthful mode of life at the time when a\ngirl is approaching maturity reacts favorably upon her development in\nevery way, and naturally enough the breasts share this benefit; but\nthe relation between unhygienic habits at about the time of puberty\nand a subsequent deficiency in lactation has been exaggerated by many\nwriters. It is impracticable, certainly, to institute special\nmeasures to prepare the breasts for their function until the need of\nsuch measures is clearly evident. Throughout pregnancy clothing about\nthe breasts should be loosely worn. If the nipples are not already\nprominent they should be drawn out; and about six or eight weeks\nbefore confinement is expected they should be given the treatment\ndescribed in Chapter V.\n\nFor the first day or so after the infant begins to nurse its efforts\nhave a tendency to injure the skin which covers the nipple; and\nunless measures to render the nipple resistant have been previously\nadopted, nursing may cause the mother considerable discomfort.\nMoreover, it is extremely important throughout lactation to keep the\nskin covering the nipple free from abrasions, for if it cracks\nbacteria have thus an opportunity to enter the glands and set up an\nacute inflammation which may result in the formation of an abscess.\nThis complication is to be avoided, not only because of the\nunpleasant symptoms which attend it, but also because for the time it\nbrings the usefulness of the breast to an end. Fortunately an abscess\nseldom impairs the breast permanently.\n\nAt any period of lactation there may be an overproduction of milk. In\nthis event the breasts are likely to become distended, hard, and very\ntender. Most frequently \"caked breasts,\" as this condition is called,\ndevelop a few days after delivery, when the secretion of milk is just\nbeginning, for at first the secretion is more plentiful than need be.\nGenerally twenty-four hours later there is an adjustment between the\nsupply of nourishment and the natural demands of the infant.\nOccasionally a longer interval elapses before the breast is\ncompletely emptied at each nursing.\n\nFormerly it was customary, whenever the breasts became tense and\nuncomfortable, to express an excess of milk by means of massage; but\nthis mode of treatment lost favor as soon as physicians realized that\nmassage stimulated the glands to greater activity. Drawing the milk\nwith a breast-pump has a somewhat similar though less potent\ninfluence, and, because pumping often affords relief when the breasts\nare distended, there is rarely any objection to it. In the light of\nmodern experience, however, most physicians prefer to avoid\nmanipulation of the breast so far as possible, and generally resort\nto other measures to relieve the mother's discomfort. Thus most\npatients are made comfortable if an appropriate bandage is used to\ntransfer the weight of the breasts from the arm-pits and the front of\nthe chest to the bones of the shoulder-girdle. It may be necessary\nalso in some cases to swathe the breasts in warm cloths; in others\ncold applications are more acceptable; the choice between these\nmethods will vary with the time of year, and usually may be left to\nthe patient herself. Now and then medicine will be employed to\nrelieve the pain, but the administration of drugs to diminish the\nproduction of milk is inadvisable. It is never very long before the\namount of milk becomes adjusted to the infant's wants, and then\ndistention disappears spontaneously. No artifice can bring about the\nadjustment as ideally as nature does.\n\nDuring the later months of lactation the liability of the breasts to\nover-filling is slight, provided the infant empties them regularly\nand completely. Nevertheless, so long as a mother is nursing her\nchild she must be careful to keep the breasts in a healthful\ncondition. They require support, yet must not be compressed. And they\nshould be covered with clothing which will adequately protect them\nfrom sudden changes of temperature. This latter precaution, perhaps,\nrequires more emphasis than formerly, on account of the present\npopularity of motoring; for the chill which one experiences when\ndriving fast may have a very unpleasant effect upon a nursing mother\nunless her breasts are carefully protected. Occasionally fever and\nneuralgic pains in the breasts are caused by motoring, or by exposure\nto the air-current from an electric fan playing directly upon them.\nBut even under these circumstances an abscess need not be feared\nunless the nipples are sore.\n\n_Human Milk_.--Between the time of birth and the beginning of\nlactation there is always an interval during which the breasts\nsecrete colostrum, just as they do throughout pregnancy. Although the\nnutritional value of this fluid is not great, it is doubtful if\ncolostrum serves any other essential purpose than as nourishment.\nPossibly it also stimulates the intestines to expel the material\nwhich has collected within, them during fetal development, yet we\nknow the bowels will move without a purgative; and often do so long\nbefore the infant is placed at the breast. Typically, the secretion\nof milk begins the third day after delivery; yet in perfectly normal\npatients it may appear as early as the second or as late as the\nfifth, and occasionally lactation does not begin until the baby is\nmore than a week old.\n\nAs to what starts the secretion of milk we have only a vague idea;\nbut we know that when the flow is once established its continuation\ndepends primarily upon the sucking efforts of the infant. If nursing\nis discontinued the secretion dwindles and the breasts dry up. On the\nother hand, the strong, persistent stimulus of the infant's suckling\ngradually brings the secretion to a high degree of efficiency. Within\nthe first two weeks, therefore, the daily secretion increases from a\nfew ounces to a pint or more. Subsequently the output fluctuates\nbetween one and two quarts daily, according to the demands made upon\nthe breasts; the secretion is larger, consequently, if there are\ntwins. Astounding yields of milk have been recorded, as in the case\nof a wet-nurse in a German institution who nursed a number of infants\nand became capable of supplying three to four quarts daily.\n\nThat newborn infants thrive better on human milk than on any other\nnourishment is a conviction that must come home to every one who has\nhad even a limited experience. It keeps the babies in health, serves\nto make them grow, and promotes the development of all their organs\nas nothing else will. Because there are present in this fluid all the\nelements necessary for nutrition, physiologists have called it a\nperfect food. Quantitatively its most important ingredient is water,\nwhich constitutes about 86 per cent. of its weight. It also contains\nabout 7 per cent. of milk-sugar, 4 per cent. of butter fat, 2 per\ncent. of protein, and 0.2 per cent. of mineral matter.\n\nThe milk of all animals contains a relatively small quantity of\nmineral matter; judged from this standpoint, the mineral matter would\nseem of minor importance, but it is actually as vital as any other\nconstituent. Without it the bones would hot harden properly; and\nother services which it performs are absolutely essential to life. As\nwe should expect, human milk contains all the mineral ingredients\nnecessary for the development of the infant; indeed, with the single\nexception of iron, they are present in the precise amounts in which\nthey are needed. In this omission, however, nature is guilty of no\noversight, since the infant has already been provided by the time of\nbirth with a rich supply of iron.\n\nTHE TECHNIQUE OF NURSING.--Since the mother should have opportunity\nto recuperate from the fatigue of labor, physicians generally\nrecommend that an interval of at least twelve hours elapse between\nthe birth of the infant and the time it is first put to the breast.\nMoreover, the best interests of the infant demand that it be kept\nwarm and left undisturbed while becoming accustomed to its new\nenvironment. There is no immediate need of food; and if there were,\nnature does not fit the mother to supply it, for at this time the\nbreasts contain merely small quantities of colostrum.\n\nSome babies nurse vigorously at the outset, but later, discouraged\nbecause they get so little, become indifferent and restless, or even\ndecline to take the breast. And the mother, who is handicapped by\ninexperience and by the awkwardness of nursing in a recumbent\nposition, often feels desperate. Fortunately technical difficulties\nare confined to the first few days, and, trying as they sometimes\nare, no one should be discouraged or imagine that she is incapable of\nnursing; for practically every woman who persists will succeed.\n\nFor a week or ten days the mother will nurse in the recumbent\nposture. She turns to one side or the other, according as the right\nor left breast is used, and holds the corresponding arm to receive\nand support the baby, which will lie beside her. Then with the\nopposite hand she holds the breast, placing her thumb above and her\nfingers below so as to keep it from the baby's face, for only in this\nway can the infant breathe freely. One must also remember that the\ninfant draws the milk into the terminal ducts chiefly with the back\nof its mouth, and drains the ducts by compressing the base of the\nnipple with its jaws; the infant therefore should take into its mouth\nnot only the nipple, but also the areola, the area of deeply colored\nskin round about it. Mothers frequently disregard these directions,\nand the failure of their infants to nurse properly may be thus\nexplained, for it is impossible to secure undisturbed nursing unless\nthey are obeyed.\n\nGenerally the breasts are employed alternately, but both may be used\nat each nursing if one is insufficient. To fix the duration of the\nnursings arbitrarily is impossible; from ten to fifteen minutes\ngenerally proves satisfactory, but in each case systematic\nobservations of the change in the baby's weight, of the character of\nits stools, and of its general condition must determine how long to\nleave it at the breast. The common error, unfortunately, is to be\nover-indulgent, and, as a result, infants are more frequently ill\nbecause the nursings are too long, than too short. Furthermore, the\nduration of the feedings can never be gauged accurately if the infant\nis allowed to nap while nursing.\n\nThe successful training of a baby begins with the development of\nregular habits of nursing. The old-fashioned custom of allowing the\nbaby to nurse whenever it cried, tacitly--and incorrectly--assumed\nthat it could have no other sensation than hunger. As a matter of\nfact an infant may have pain from overfeeding. Again, it may be\nthirsty, or uncomfortable from the pricking of a pin, from the\nmonotony of one position, from a soiled napkin, or from neglect of\nmany simple details in its care. Any of these things make a baby cry,\nfor it has no other means by which it can express disapproval.\n\nSo long as the breasts contain colostrum the nursings should be at\nleast three hours apart during the day; at night it is preferable not\nto disturb the mother at all. As soon as milk appears the interval is\nusually shortened to two hours during the day. In many cases,\nhowever, the three-hour interval will be retained even after the milk\nappears, for otherwise the infant may not become hungry and will fail\nto nurse as strongly as it should. The following schedule is adapted\nto the average infant:\n\n           Age                 Interval During     Total Number\n                                   the Day          of Feedings\n  From  1st  to    4th week       2      hours            9\n    \"   4th   \"    8th  \"         2-1/2    \"              8\n    \"   2nd   \"    4th month      3        \"              7\n    \"   4th   \"   10th   \"        3        \"              6\n    \"  10th   \"   12th   \"        4        \"              5\n\nAfter the first few days most young infants require one feeding in\nthe middle of the night, which is usually given about 2 A.M. The day\nfeedings then begin at 6 A.M., and are repeated at regular intervals\nuntil 9 or 10 P.M. The daily bath should be scheduled so that a\nfeeding will be due just after the bath has been completed. If asleep\nwhen the next succeeding feeding falls due, the infant should not be\nwaked, but at other times nothing should interfere with the\nregularity of the schedule. Occasionally there may be difficulty in\ngetting the child to nurse during the day, but it must be taught to\ndo so; otherwise it will want to nurse throughout the night.\n\nAt no time should an infant remain in the bed with its mother after\nit has finished nursing; at night this rule must be rigidly enforced,\nfor mothers have been known to fall asleep and smother the baby, an\naccident known as over-lying. Infants can frequently be trained to go\nwithout feeding in the middle of the night even when a month old; and\nsuch training is always advisable, since it affords the mother\nopportunity for six or eight hours' continuous sleep.\n\nBefore and after each nursing the mothers' nipple should be cleansed\nwith a solution of boric acid made by placing a tablespoonful of the\npowder in a tumbler which is then filled with water. Such cleansing\nprotects the breasts against infection, a complication which the\nnursing mother must spare no pains to prevent. Now and then, in spite\nof conscientious efforts to harden them, the nipples become sore. If\nthey crack, the baby's mouth must not come in direct contact with\nthem, since nursing with a cracked nipple is a common source of a\ngathered breast. Fortunately when a nipple cracks we may employ a\nshield, obtainable at any drug-store, which enables the infant to\nnurse without any danger to the mother. Most babies will take the\nshield as well as the breast itself; nevertheless, its use should be\ndiscontinued as soon as the nipple heals, for while the shield is\nused the secretion of milk is not stimulated as vigorously as when\nthe infant nurses directly from the breast. In the rare cases in\nwhich the shield cannot be used satisfactorily the infant must be\ntaken from the breast temporarily and given a bottle. Radical as this\nadvice may appear, the mother must consent to follow it, for, as I\nhave pointed out, to permit an infant to nurse a cracked nipple is\nextremely hazardous. When treatment is begun promptly the cracks will\ngenerally heal within twenty-four hours.\n\nHYGIENE OF THE MOTHER.--Since the mammary glands manufacture their\nproduct from the constituents of the mother's blood and their\nactivity is controlled by her nerves, it is clear that her physical\ncondition and her state of mind will influence the secretion of milk.\nIntelligent women who understand this desire to know how they should\nlive that they may best insure an ample supply of good milk.\nFortunately the first important step toward success has been taken\nwhen a mother wishes to nurse her baby; but there are also necessary\nwholesome food, habits conducive to health, and a mind free from\nworry.\n\nIt is unfortunate that current beliefs throw many restrictions about\nnursing-mothers which are unreasonable and unsupported by scientific\ninvestigation. There was a time when mothers did not question their\nability to nurse, they assumed this duty as a matter of course.\nIndeed, they were compelled to do so, since refined methods of\nartificial feeding had not as yet been devised. Among the\nagricultural class, even to-day, it is exceptional for mothers to\nfail to nurse their children, if they are provided with the ordinary\ncomforts of life. But women who live at the higher tension of city\nlife are frequently unsuccessful, because they are more inclined to\nbe nervous or because they disregard, among other things, the need of\nfresh air, plain food, or regular habits. It is wrong to suppose that\nelaborate rules of conduct are necessary for nursing mothers; the\ninstruction they require is simple and scarcely different from that\nto be given anyone who desires good health. If she lead a wholesome\nexistence a woman will not only nurse her child successfully but will\ngain in strength.\n\n_Diet_.--In manufacturing centers, where a large proportion of\nthe women are employed in confining work, the percentage of mothers\nwho are able to nurse their children is exceedingly small;\nconsequently the infant mortality is very high. Better nourishment\nfor the mother, it has seemed, would render her more capable of\nsuccessful lactation, and would decrease or even eliminate badly\nexecuted artificial feeding, and would therefore reduce the death\nrate among the babies. In a few foreign cities the idea has been put\ninto practice. Free restaurants have been established for working\nmothers, and they have thus been enabled to perform their maternal\nduties much more successfully. Incidentally it has been shown that\nnourishment may be supplied mother and infant at a smaller cost than\nproper artificial food for the infant alone.\n\nThe quantity of nourishment required by nursing mothers is not so\nlarge as might be expected, and in many instances it is over-feeding\nrather than under-feeding that must be guarded against. Very accurate\nobservations have been made which indicate that during the early\nweeks of nursing no more food is needed than at other times; in all\nprobability this remains true throughout the whole period of\nlactation. Over-eating, as many of us know, is a frequent cause of\nindigestion. It is of the first importance, therefore, that nursing\nmothers should not take more food than they can assimilate, for\nindigestion will provoke disturbances in the milk which in turn will\nmake the baby uncomfortable. For a similar reason mothers should have\ntheir meals at regular intervals.\n\nAs a rule the appetite is a reliable guide not only as to how much to\neat, but also as to the choice of food, for without exception what is\ngood for the mother is good also for the child. Generally the diet\nshould be a mixed one, consisting of milk, gruels, soups, vegetables,\nbread, and meat. In order that monotony may not dull the appetite, no\none article of food should be employed continuously. With this\nexception food should be selected with regard only for its\nwholesomeness and digestibility. All food is milk-making food; no\nsharp distinctions between the various kinds can be recognized. Milk,\nbecause it contains all the elements necessary for perfect nutrition,\nis particularly wholesome. Water also, since it forms such a large\nproportion of their milk, should be taken freely by nursing mothers.\nGenerally it proves advantageous to take milk or some other\nnutritious drink between meals and again before retiring at night,\nbut the danger of ruining in this way the appetite for solid food\nmust not be overlooked.\n\nIt ought to be unnecessary to say that a nursing mother should deny\nherself any article of food, no matter how much she may want it, if\nshe knows it will disagree with her; but she must remember also that\nthe same article of food will not necessarily disagree with other\nmothers. Generalizations of this kind are largely responsible for the\nwrongful tendency to reject from the dietary many altogether harmless\narticles. There would be little left for a nursing mother to eat if\nshe avoided every article of food which one person or another assures\nher will damage her milk.\n\nNo belief regarding what a nursing mother should eat is held more\nwidely, I suppose, than that she should abstain from salads,\ntomatoes, and fruits which contain acid. This view is erroneous. The\nvery idea upon which it is based is incorrect, since acids are\nneutralized as soon as they pass from the stomach to the intestines\nand cannot enter the milk. With certain persons some varieties of\nfruit invariably cause indigestion. Lactation does not correct such\nan individual peculiarity, and a nursing mother who knows she\npossesses it will act accordingly. Occasionally those who have no\nsuch idiosyncrasy worry after they have eaten something which\ncontains an acid because they have heard it will do harm. In such\ncases it is the mental state of the woman which disturbs her milk and\nupsets the baby. With the exception of those who have such an\nidiosyncrasy and those inclined to worry, nursing mothers may partake\nof fruits and salads with impunity.\n\nThere are vegetables, of which the onion and turnip are good\nexamples, that contain ingredients that find their way unaltered into\nthe milk. So long as these do not disturb the mother their presence\nhas no unfavorable influence upon the child. Similarly a number of\nsubstances appear in the milk when administered as medicine to the\nmother. In one way this is fortunate, for under certain circumstances\nit provides a very satisfactory method of treating unhealthy children\nwithout giving the medicine directly. In another respect, however, it\nis a disadvantage, for it sometimes interferes with giving the mother\npurgatives, which she may need. So far as possible, therefore, the\ntaking of medicine should be limited during lactation, and certainly\nno drug should be employed without the advice of a physician.\n\nTime and again some drug, some beverage, usually one that contains\nalcohol, or some special article of food has been recommended as a\nmeans of increasing an inadequate secretion of milk, but thus far all\nattempts in this direction have failed of general application. There\nare at present on the market widely advertised preparations for which\nastounding efficiency is claimed. None of them, however, has a\ndefinite or consistent value; and it is unfortunately true that no\nsubstance has yet been discovered that has the specific action of\nincreasing the production of milk.\n\n_Psychic Influence_.--Although the nerves of the breast which\nregulate the secretion of milk do their work whether the mother wills\nit or not, her state of mind has an influence over the process, just\nas it has over digestion. No one doubts that our minds influence our\ndigestions as has been so clearly proved by the skillful experiments\nof Pawlow, an eminent Russian physiologist. Cheerfulness promotes\nperfect assimilation of the food, whereas mental depression decreases\nthe secretion of the digestive juices or checks them altogether. In a\nsimilar way, perhaps, we shall some day have explained to us the\nunquestioned fact that mothers who maintain a happy disposition nurse\ntheir babies efficiently, while those who are inclined to worry often\nexperience real or imaginary troubles with lactation.\n\nThe most striking manifestations of such psychic influences are those\nin which, as a result of some strong passion or deep sorrow, the\nsecretion of milk suddenly ceases altogether. Fortunately such\neffects occur rarely and are never permanent. After a few hours at\nmost the secretion is reestablished; and if there are alterations in\nthe quality of the milk, these will correct themselves just as\nquickly.\n\nMore common, and therefore much more important, are cases in which,\nbecause the mother allows herself day after day to worry over one\nthing or another, the secretion of milk suffers permanent disturbance\nin quantity or in quality. Sometimes worrying lest the milk will be\nunsatisfactory causes it to become so. Generally, however,\nunnecessary anxiety for the baby is to blame. Again and again, when\nthere is really nothing out of the way, inexperienced mothers make\nthemselves miserable because they fear something may go wrong. Such a\nstate of mind always invites trouble; not infrequently it is the\ndirect cause of insufficient or unwholesome milk. The self-assurance\ngained through taking care of the first baby is responsible more than\nanything else for the greater success mothers have in nursing\nsubsequent children.\n\nThe mother who is nursing her first baby should take success for\ngranted, and never mistrust her ability to succeed. If the physician\nhas been asked to visit the baby regularly, as was suggested at the\nbeginning of this chapter, he will quickly detect the evidence of\nfailure should failure be imminent. His opinions should be accepted\nand his directions followed, for by so doing the mother will most\nreadily acquire the assurance which is so necessary to success. The\nhabit, easily fallen into, of paying attention to promiscuous advice\nis unwholesome, for such advice is injudiciously given and is usually\nincorrect. More often than not the counsel of well-meaning friends\nonly serves to perplex and distress the mother.\n\n_Recreation and Rest_.--Next to worry no influence upon\nlactation is more detrimental than neglect of recreation and rest.\nBoth are very necessary to a nursing mother, for without them she\nwill soon begin to exaggerate minor troubles and even to worry though\nnothing is wrong. A mother who has the care of a baby added to other\nresponsibilities may have extraordinary difficulty in finding time\nfor outdoor exercise, for congenial companionship, or for diversion\nof any kind. Occasionally it may seem almost impossible even to get\ntime for sleep, a necessity so fundamental to health that, as we\nshould expect, a mother deprived of it would fail utterly in nursing\nher infant. Difficult as it may seem, however, the mother must find\ntime for recreation, for if she does not there will follow\ndisturbances, generally in the quantity, or sometimes in the quality,\nof her milk.\n\nKeeping in mind that whatever benefits the mother will react\nfavorably upon the infant, one should regulate exercise during\nlactation with regard to the kind and the amount of exercise to which\nshe has been previously accustomed. Walking usually fulfils all the\nrequirements satisfactorily, and there is ordinarily no reason why\nnursing mothers should not participate in sports that are unattended\nby violent exertion. Exhausting sports, however, must be shunned,\nbecause fatigue has the same injurious effect upon the secretion of\nmilk as lack of exercise.\n\nAs might be expected, women who are frail are most susceptible to the\nstrain of nursing, especially if they fail to get sufficient rest.\nAll nursing mothers ought to have at least eight hours of sleep in\nthe twenty-four. The night-feeding, generally advisable for the first\nsix to eight weeks, does not break the mother's rest longer than half\nan hour if the baby is well trained. But if a baby that has not been\nproperly trained turns night into day and keeps the mother awake for\nlong intervals, the milk will quickly deteriorate. Under such\ncircumstances someone must relieve the mother of the care of the\ninfant during the night; she should not be disturbed even to nurse\nit. The night-feeding will then be supplied artificially; as will\nalso one feeding during the day in order that the mother may have\nopportunity for exercise and diversion.\n\nTHE SUPPLEMENTARY BOTTLE.--At first glance it may seem that in the\nsuggestion that the infant be given one artificial feeding each day\nthe mother's comfort alone has been considered. As a matter of fact,\nhowever, the adoption of the plan benefits mother and infant alike.\nThe diversion and recreation which the mother, thus relieved of her\nmaternal duties for from four to six hours, has time to secure\nbecomes a direct benefit to the infant. Not infrequently by pursuing\nthis plan, mothers who would otherwise be incapable of nursing are\nassured successful lactation. The child, moreover, having thus become\naccustomed to the bottle, is much more easily denied the breast when\nthe time for weaning comes.\n\nObjections have been raised to giving the baby even one bottle when\nthe mother has an ample supply of milk, but none of them are valid.\nSince cow's milk is acknowledged to be less easy of digestion than is\nhuman milk, it will occur to someone that there is danger of\nupsetting the baby by giving it a bottle. But this need not be\nfeared; extensive experience has shown that if an infant is getting\nhuman milk of satisfactory quality at all its feedings during the\ntwenty-four hours, save one or two, at these times it will digest\nproperly modified cow's milk without the least inconvenience. Nor is\nit true that if once a day cow's milk is substituted for that of the\nmother, the infant will come to prefer the bottle to the breast.\nThere is no danger, on the other hand, that the mother's milk will\ndry up. Very thorough investigation of these objections has failed to\nsubstantiate them in the least.\n\nOf course, it will be necessary in preparing the supplementary\nfeeding to take the same precautions as if the infant were on the\nbottle exclusively. To avoid contamination of the milk care must be\nexercised to have everything perfectly clean that comes in contact\nwith it. And it will be necessary also to vary from time to time both\nthe strength and the amount of the feeding. These alterations will be\nmade most successfully if left to the judgment of a physician who is\nfamiliar with the development of the infant and who may be guided\naccordingly.\n\nWEANING.--Occasionally, even before they are delivered, women express\nthe conviction that they will be incapable of nursing. A few mothers\nwho take this attitude, which it would seem is becoming more and more\ncommon, make no attempt at nursing, and others give it up after a\nvery short trial. Premature weaning is practiced among the women of\ntwo widely different classes: those who are unwilling to deny\nthemselves social pleasures, and those who, because they must earn a\nliving, cannot be encumbered with maternal duties. A still larger\nclass, however, are those mothers who wean the baby for neither of\nthese reasons, but rather because they become discouraged and\nconclude that there is something wrong with their milk. In this way\nmany infants are weaned without sufficient reason. Before giving up\nnursing her child a mother should submit several samples of the milk\nfor analysis. If it is unfit for the infant, reliable evidence of the\nfact will often be secured in this way.\n\nWith the exception of tuberculosis, physicians recognize no condition\nthat necessarily unfits a mother for nursing. As we have already\nseen, pregnancy is generally incompatible with lactation; in the\nevent of conception the mother's milk almost always takes on\nqualities which render it unsatisfactory for the infant, and yet\noccasionally pregnancy advances several months before these changes\nin the milk occur. Meanwhile the infant suffers no inconvenience, and\noften in these cases the symptoms of threatened miscarriage give the\nfirst intimation of the mother's condition. Under all circumstances,\nhowever, nursing should cease as soon as the mother recognizes that\nshe is pregnant, for probably no woman is strong enough to provide\nnourishment for her infant and for the development of the embryo\nsimultaneously.\n\nMenstruation, on the other hand, rarely if ever provides a good and\nsufficient reason for weaning. In the great majority of instances\nthis function is re-established before lactation ends. There may be a\nreduction in the amount of milk during menstruation, but if the\ninfant has been given the breast as usual, the supply increases as\nsoon as the period ends. Qualitative disturbances which would render\nthe milk unfit for use are practically never a consequence of\nmenstruation.\n\nIt may happen as the infant grows older that the flow of milk will\ndiminish; then the breast feedings will of necessity be more\nfrequently replaced by the bottle, and the question of weaning will\nsettle itself. But if the time of weaning is a matter of choice, it\nshould be approximately coincident with certain notable developments\nin the infant's digestive functions, which occur toward the end of\nthe first year. The fact that the infant is prepared to take other\nfood is outwardly shown by the appearance of teeth, of which there\nare usually six or eight at the end of the year.\n\nIf the suggestion regarding the daily substitution of one bottle for\nthe mother's milk has been adopted, there will be no difficulty in\ndiscontinuing breast-feeding whenever it is desirable; otherwise an\ninfant may raise strong objection to the change. The mother, on the\nother hand, will not be seriously inconvenienced by the weaning,\nprovided she leaves her breasts alone.\n\nUntil recently mothers were advised to employ a very elaborate\ntreatment for drying up the breasts. The diet was restricted, and as\nfar as possible liquids of every kind were forbidden; strong\npurgatives were administered daily; and, in addition, the breasts\nwere covered with some ointment, swathed in cotton, and tightly\ncompressed with a bandage. Fortunately, we now realize that none of\nthese measures are required. When nursing is discontinued the breasts\nare apt to become distended and uncomfortable. They require support\nwhile the distention lasts, which is never very long, and if they\nbecome painful, medicine may be employed to give relief. But other\nmeasures, some of which occasionally do harm, are absolutely\nunnecessary, for, at whatever period of lactation the breasts cease\nto be used, they dry up spontaneously.\n\n\n\n\nGLOSSARY\n\n\n[Footnote: The Century Dictionary has been freely used for these\ndefinitions.]\n\n\nABNORMAL.--Irregular; deviating from the natural or standard type.\n\nABORTIFACIENT.--Whatever is used to produce an abortion.\n\nABORTION.--The expulsion of the embryo during the first four months\nof pregnancy.\n\nAFTER-BIRTH.--The mass of tissue expelled from the uterus at the end\nof labor.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",
